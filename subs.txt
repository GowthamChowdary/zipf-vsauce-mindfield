Oh hello 
Technology isn t just
changing our lives 
It s changing our brains 
Not just how they think 
but how they look 
It s been shown that playing
certain video games for hours
can improve your memory
for details 
your ability
to navigate space
in video games 
and can make your brain 
well certain parts
of it bigger 
But scientists want to know
if exploring digital worlds
can change our brains
in ways that improve our ability
to navigate the real world 
To find out 
we ve built a giant maze
to test their theories
for the first time ever
outside the world of computers 
And my job 
I m the lab rat 
 theme music playing 
 vacuum humming stops 
Our brains have been
profoundly transformed
by our interactions
with technology 
A lot of the information
that I used to have to store
in my brain
is now stored in my phone 
My contacts my schedule 
In many ways I ve delegated
what used to be done
by this organ
to this new external organ 
Doing that frees up
by brain s resources
for other things that matter
or that technology
can t quite do for us yet 
So while we all don t have
implants in our brains yet 
technology has already found
a way into our heads 
which is why you may find it
deeply disturbing
to see me do something
like this 
Sh 
 music playing 
 Michael Studies show
we can improve our brains
by having enriching
experiences 
even by playing video games 
To learn more about this 
I came to UC Irvine s Stark Lab
to speak with experts
in the field of learning
and memory 
So Dane and Craig 
you guys work on
learning and memory 
 What about them 
 So the lab is trying
to figure out
how memory works 
how it works in the brain 
And one brain structure in the
temporal lobe
that we know is important to
memory is
the hippocampus 
So what does
the hippocampus do 
We know it has a role in memory
and really a certain
kind of memory 
The hippocampus
is really involved
when you need to rapidly form
new arbitrary associations 
You know remembering
what you did yesterday
definitely needs
Maybe we ll go the store 
we park our car in the lot 
and we need to be able
to remember
not just I parked
my car in the lot 
I parked my car
in this exact spot
in the lot 
 Michael Right 
 Craig And those details 
that s what the hippocampus
seems to be really be
helping us out on 
And you keep looking down
at this piece of chewed
bubblegum on the book 
is that a hippocampus 
 Craig Yes This actually
is my hippocampus 
Is this the whole thing
or is it symmetric 
That s it 
Oh there s one
on the other side 
That looks just like this 
Yeah mirror image of it 
 Michael In 
Dr Stark and Dr Clemenson 
conducted a study to show
how video games
affect the brain 
They gathered participants
who normally didn t play
video games
and split them up
into three groups 
A control group who didn t play
any video games for two weeks 
an active control group
who played two dimensional
games for two weeks 
and an experimental group
who played D games
for two weeks 
Beforehand they had all
the participants
perform two virtual tasks
on computers
to measure
their spatial memory 
As soon as they came back 
we re administered
those two tasks 
And what we found was that the
people who played the D game
saw an improving
in their test scores 
whereas the control group
and active control group
did not 
We didn t do brain scans 
but we can speculate
that there were changes
to the experimental group s
hippocampi 
So what are we going to be
doing to me here 
So we re gonna do everything
that we ve done before
in our past studies 
except we re gonna add
two new things 
Uh the first is we re gonna
add some brain scans 
so we re gonna see
if we see a change
in the structural side
of your hippocampus 
We ve never actually looked
at somebody s brain scans
before and after
they played video games 
And the second thing
we re actually gonna do
is we re gonna put you through
a real world space 
You re gonna be the rat
in a maze 
 Michael 
This truly untested territory 
The effect of video gaming
on spatial memory
has never been studied
in a physical environment
on a scale this big
and comprehensive 
I will have to navigate my way
through a square foot
physical maze 
Will playing video games
improve my mental skills
in the real world 
If so society
may start looking
at gaming in a whole new way 
First we had to get
baseline measurements
of my brain 
Welcome to the MRI Center 
We re gonna be taking a whole
series of scans of you 
as the before scan
to then see what s gonna be
happening to your brain
as a function of actually
doing the gaming 
Cool What kind of things
are you looking for 
Changes in the size and shape
of your hippocampus
and also changes
in the connectivity
between brain regions 
 Michael My brain was scanned
using diffusion MRI 
with a special emphasis
on my all important
hippocampus 
 Craig So this first test
is a standard memory test
that we do 
It s called an object
recognition memory test 
This test began by showing me
a series of random objects 
I did my best to commit
every one of them to memory 
Okay 
 Finished 
 All right 
What we re gonna do now though 
is we re gonna test
 your memory for those objects 
 Okay 
And this is actually
where it starts to tap
into the hippocampus
that we know is so important
for things
like spatial memory 
 Michael This time I had to
view another series of objects
and identify
any that were identical
to the ones
I d seen previously 
The catch some of the items
were very similar
to the earlier ones 
but not exactly the same 
This tested my memory
for details
and very slight changes 
 Michael Next up a virtual
version of a water maze
normally used by rodents
and mice 
 Dane The idea is that
you are trying to locate
a hidden platform
in a pool of water 
 Michael Oh man 
I m so glad I m not a lab rat 
This task really put my spatial
memory to the test 
I had to find the same
invisible underwater platform
over and over again 
using only the shapes
of the mountains as my guide 
but at least I didn t have
to get wet 
Hey 
That was more difficult
than I expected 
 Craig These are the sorts of
tasks that we ve been able to do
because we can put them
on a computer 
And we re gonna revisit them
after you ve done
the video games 
But we also have a really
great opportunity here now
to be able to try to take it out
of just doing it on the computer
and actually get it
into the real world 
Have you guys done
this before 
No We don t get to do
this kind of thing 
 Well welcome
to the Mind Field 
 Awesome 
So this is it It s huge 
 Craig This is what
we brought you here for 
to have a real world test
of memory 
You re gonna be
a lab rat in a maze 
So this is a big first for us 
It s a big first really
for memory research 
So how do you think
that ll effect
what you guys
have already seen 
which is
that moving around
in a D environment
in a video game can
actually physically
affect your brain 
 Dane We would expect that
if we can somehow kind of 
train your hippocampus
to be better
at spatial memory
and spatial navigation 
we would see improvements
in some of these areas 
And it s not just
gonna be running a maze 
You ve got objects
embedded inside here 
and we re gonna be testing
your ability to remember
where everything is 
Oh and build a mental map
of whatever s inside there 
 Craig 
So you have five minutes 
Go on in explore 
learn the maze 
and learn the objects 
Go 
 Michael Because the walls
were six feet tall 
I was unable to get
a bird s eye view 
My task was to create
a spatial memory
based entirely on the angles
and turns of the white walls
I could see at eye level 
and a few tall trees
and light poles
outside the maze 
Okay So I ve oriented myself 
The entrance is that way 
There s an exit over there 
I m considering this the right
side that the left side 
I ve got a vague idea
of where things are
that I feel like exist
along the outside edge 
but I don t know about
a lot of the stuff inside 
 Craig And time 
All right So
now you ve had a chance
to explore the maze 
find out where
the objects are 
Now we re gonna test
your memory 
 and we ll be timing you
and seeing where you go 
 Okay You ready 
 I m ready 
 Dane So your first object
is the bicycle pump 
 Go 
 Michael Pump Okay 
 Michael Pump was just
always making right turns 
hugging the rightmost
part of pump 
Ha ha Yes Easy Okay 
Now I guess I do the opposite
to get out 
Left side yup 
I think I should make this turn 
There it is 
 You asked for a pump 
Item two the basketball 
 Michael Later Dr Stark
and Dr Clemenson
would evaluate my performance
on how fast I was 
the number of errors I made 
and whether I took the most
optimal route each time 
Third item
is the cat Go 
Here kitty kitty kitty 
Got it 
 Dane The fourth item
is the pillow 
Retracing my steps 
 Dane The crayon 
 Michael Easy 
 Dane The book 
 Michael Okay 
 Dane The boot 
Last item
is the water bottle 
 Michael Water bottle 
I think 
by 
Yeah it was back here 
Maybe on the other side
of this wall 
No Oh shoot 
Okay Maybe it s down here 
Oh wait 
That s no 
That s the central cube 
It was down some sort of 
a long corridor like this
in this area 
Oh man 
 Michael Until this point 
things had gone pretty well 
but now it felt like
my hippocampus was failing me 
With most of the items
now gone 
I couldn t use them
for reference 
and it was difficult
to distinguish the differences
between the various
white corridors 
Oh dang it 
Oh what about through 
 Bottle coming up 
 Craig All right 
There you go 
 Michael Got it Nice 
 That one was a little
tougher huh 
Yeah it was tougher 
 So we found all eight objects 
 Yup 
 Dane Now we re gonna make it
a little bit more difficult 
So we re gonna move
onto the next phase
and that s gonna be
from the other side 
 Craig Navigating
the maze in reverse
will be an even bigger test
of your spatial memory 
We re gonna give you
a list of four things to get 
in order 
 Dane So the first sequence
is the book 
the bottle the crayon 
and the boot 
 Michael Book 
That s the ball 
Oh yeah bottle
was that hard one 
but now I remember
which alley to go down 
Perfect 
Crayon 
Boot Don t want that 
Here it is 
Okay Now I need the boot 
Oh I just saw the boot 
but how did I 
I m done I m coming back 
 Got them 
So then the next four 
 Dane The pump the pillow 
the basketball and the cat 
 Craig All right Excellent 
 Dane All right Nice job 
 Michael Okay 
So that was really fun 
but I can t be
the only subject 
This experiment
could use a control 
How else will we know that me 
enriching my life
with daily
video game playing 
really causes a change
in my spatial memory right 
Well luckily for that 
we ve got a nice
matched control 
Guys similar to me 
Okay one of them
has too much hair 
but you guys look good 
 You ready 
 all Ready 
 Michael In every experiment 
it s important to have
a control group 
My look alikes had to go
through the exact same tests
as I did in the maze
to establish
their individual baselines 
The difference would be
that they would play
absolutely no video games
for the next days 
Then any change
in my performance
would be compared against
any changes in theirs 
Next I began
my gaming regimen 
starting
from an ideal baseline 
since I haven t played
since I was a kid 
Would ten days of gaming
really make a difference 
Technology isn t just affecting
the way we remember things 
 whirring 
 It s also playing
with the empathy
and social circuits
of our brains 
In fact in many cases 
we are more comfortable
relating to machines
than we are to people 
Just think about how much
we care about our phones 
Roboticist
and MIT Media Lab alum 
Alex Reben 
invented the BlabDroid 
a miniature robot equipped
with a camera
and an innocent little voice
that asks
very personal questions
of unsuspecting pedestrians 
 BlabDroid If you could
take back one mistake 
what would it be 
Oh gosh 
I only get to take back one 
The majority of people
instantly shared
intimate details 
 BlabDroid Tell me something
that you ve never told
a stranger before 
I m scared
I won t be able to love
and to let myself go
in a love relationship 
 Michael In many ways 
talking to a machine
than to a human 
But what about talking
through a machine 
I mean it s often easier to say
difficult things
to a person via text
instead of in real life 
isn t it 
Well what if the person
on the other end
wasn t a friend
or a significant other 
but was a therapist 
A mental healthcare startup
called Talkspace
allows adult users
who pay a weekly fee
to text therapists for advice 
 woman At Talkspace 
we believe that therapy
should be anonymous 
stigma free 
simple affordable 
and comfortable 
Texting can give users
the distance they need
to be open and honest 
And messages can be sent
when the user wants 
not during an appointment
or business hours only 
 woman Talkspace 
therapy for how we live today 
 Michael How am I 
Better now that my phone
is working 
Sometimes however 
we aren t looking for
technology to comfort us 
we re finding ourselves
wanting to comfort technology 
This is a ROBOTIS OP 
Cute little fellow isn t he 
So how did that make you feel 
Bad 
Well why 
Robots are just machines 
metal and wires
and computer chips 
But we spend a lot of time
We depend on technology 
and we care about it 
But the degree to which
we empathize with it
depends on context 
Recently my Vsauce office
was invaded by bugs 
robot hexbugs that is 
These bugs are made
of plastic metal 
and electronic circuitry 
They aren t alive 
But could certain conditions
cause them to inspire
empathy in humans 
A MIT study
found that giving a robot
movement a name 
and a personal backstory
tends to increase
its anthropomorphic effect 
which can lead to
an emotional connection
with humans 
We decided to see this in
action 
 Thank you for your help today 
 Of course Pleasure 
In our demonstration 
our subjects think
they re focus testing
a new user friendly technology 
In this case 
they re given a lifeless hexbug
and asked to describe it 
This thing kind of
looks like a bug 
only I don t know
what it does 
It has a switch on the bottom 
It s light 
It s sort of a rectangle 
but the ends
are like hexagons 
 Michael Then it was time
to test their empathy 
Now Karina 
what I would
like you to do now
is place the item
in the middle
of that block 
There s a magnet
that will hold it 
And I would like for you
to take this mallet
and please smash it 
Yeah Really Okay 
This is cool 
 Michael Our participants
demonstrated no resistance
to smashing
this lifeless object 
Many of them
even seemed to enjoy it 
Do you feel bad
for breaking it 
Not really 
I felt indifferent to it 
Not really cause
it wasn t real laughing 
 Michael While these subjects
exhibited no empathy
to the inanimate bugs 
look what happened when we gave
the exact same bugs
names and movement 
This is Margaret Okay 
I m gonna place Margaret
down here 
I just want you
to take a moment
to watch Margaret 
all right 
And you could feel free
to pick her up 
She s really well behaved 
 She s honestly one
of our favorites 
 woman laughing Okay 
So how would you describe
Margaret s personality 
A little erratic right now 
but I think if I pick her up 
she calms down 
 Michael Notice
how the subject has already
anthropomorphized the object 
referring to it as she 
Maybe she feeds off
my energy 
Could be 
Go towards the light 
Go towards the middle 
 Michael Do you think
Margaret likes you 
Yeah maybe that s why
she s doing this 
and maybe when I go
like that 
she doesn t act
all erratic 
That s Aaron 
Hi Aaron 
He can be a bit
of a pistol 
 No way 
 Yes 
It really depends on
who s holding him 
 laughing 
Oh yeah 
He s got a lot of energy 
Aaron hi 
 Michael Now that you ve
interacted with Eli a bit more 
how would you describe
his personality 
Probably he s just nervous 
He s scared 
 He doesn t know
what s going on 
 Hey Joe 
 Michael Will these subjects
be just as willing
to smash their bugs 
Amy I m gonna place
Margaret right here 
and then I
would like for you
to take this mallet 
and I d like you
to smash it 
No 
I don t wanna hurt it 
Just take this mallet
and smash Aaron 
I m gonna ask you
and I d like for you
Smash it 
Hit it 
And Chris 
You want me to kill Joe 
Please smash Joe 
Ugh 
Joe I m sorry 
Oh Joe Joe 
Now how did it feel
to smash Aaron 
It didn t feel good 
you know 
after spending time with him
and getting to know him 
Even though
it s lifeless
and doesn t have a mind
of its own 
instantly 
I grew attached to it 
because when I put it
in my hand 
I felt its energy 
I m sorry Joe 
 Do you feel bad 
 I do 
I do feel bad about Joe 
He was pretty cool 
Oh he s back 
He s back 
Pump pump 
Would you smash him again
to make sure
he doesn t come back 
 No 
 Why not 
I mean he survived it 
He survived it once 
I m not gonna do it again 
 Michael Clearly 
it doesn t take much for humans
to become emotionally
attached to technology 
But after my ten days
of video gaming 
Nice 
I was about to find out
if technology had
affected my spatial memory
and my physical brain 
 Michael All right 
It s been ten days 
Exactly so we re gonna look
at the difference between
your test ten days ago
and your test now
to see
do we see any change 
First I had to retake
the object recognition
memory test
and the Morris water maze task 
both of which had been revised
with different content
than they had the last time 
I think I did better 
Dane and I will
analyze all this data
and see how you did 
But now we got to go back
to the full size maze 
So we ve got a new maze 
Tore down the old one 
built a new one
to try to be isomorphic 
So it has sort of the same
level of difficulty 
The same number
of choice points 
the same number of turns 
the same total distance
to each of one the objects
to try to have a similar maze 
but that s new 
Three two one go 
 Michael Right around here 
we got a bonsai 
As before 
I was given five minutes
to familiarize myself
with the maze
and where all
of the objects were 
Now this is where I was
before I hugged that wall 
so if I hug
the second right wall
and stay all the way right 
a vase 
Was my hippocampus
working better 
At this point 
it was hard to tell 
Thirty seconds 
I m not even sure
I ve discovered
all the objects hidden here 
And time 
Then my test began 
First object
is a rubber duck 
 Rubber duck was way over here 
Yeah 
How do you like that 
I got a duck 
Second item
is the hat Go 
 Michael With this maze 
I found myself instinctively
using a different approach 
Top hat 
Instead of thinking of the
overall geography of the maze
like I did last time 
this time I was remembering
specific details 
Second right 
hug the turn got it 
Literally recalling
certain corners 
turns and straightaways 
Bonsai 
Now blue vase 
Oh wow 
It s actually a cool vase 
But would this improve
my overall performance 
I got you a backpack 
 Excellent 
So we ve gotten
all the objects 
But of course we have
another memory test
that we re gonna do here 
We re gonna go around
to the other side of the maze
and test your memory
from there 
 Michael All right 
 Dane So your first sequence
is the blue seahorse
the flashlight 
the rubber duck 
and the bonsai tree 
With the multiple item tasks 
even though I was working
from the opposite entrance 
I continued to recall
various details of the maze 
which seemed to serve me well 
From there 
it s just a little spiral 
 bell dings 
 Dane All right Your next
sequence is the blue vase 
the hat the backpack 
and the baseball glove 
 Craig Hit it 
 And time 
So how was it 
That was not as hard
as I expected 
 It was about details 
 Craig Right 
I was literally
thinking Oh okay 
There s that turn 
and I could do one
or two things 
The glove s
the first one 
The bonsai s the one
even before 
I didn t even
plan that at all 
It just kind of happened 
 Michael My look alikes were
also tested in the new maze 
Have you been playing
video games 
 all No sir 
 Michael Again 
their non gaming condition
would be the control 
with my amount of improvement 
if any 
measured against theirs 
 Craig All right 
We re here for scan number two 
 Michael Finally 
my brain was scanned once again
to determine whether
any physical changes
had occurred 
Dr Stark and Dr Clemenson
would analyze the MRI
along with all the other data
and report their findings 
 Michael I feel like
my hippocampus
is a little bit bigger 
Yep Actually no 
I don t know 
I m anxious to see
what your results are 
I guess let s start
off first
with the object
recognition task 
And it s important to note
that in our control test
without video gaming 
people did not improve
in this task but 
your memory got better 
You went up by ten points 
Ten points is actually
 years worth
of what happens
to us as we age 
That s about what you might see
in someone
who s getting really old 
 but they might go down
by ten points 
 Exactly 
So the second one we did
was the virtual version
of the water maze task 
and you actually performed
 better the second time
you did it 
Hey not bad 
I could tell that I was
using better strategies 
Yeah 
 We also had the real maze 
 Michael Yeah 
 Craig As you know 
we made two mazes 
Despite our efforts
to try to equate them 
the second maze was
a little bit more difficult
than the first maze 
If we took a look
at things
like how quickly you
got the objects 
how many errors you made 
and we looked
at the control subjects 
performance in
pre versus post 
So on all of them 
they actually got a little
bit slower in maze two 
and all but one of them
made more errors 
We took a look
at your performance 
You didn t get slower
from maze one to two 
You actually got faster 
 Michael Really 
 Craig And you made the same
exact number of errors 
So they don t improve 
and you did 
And even though
this experiment
had a small number
of subjects 
the results are consistent
with our virtual maze study
with test subjects 
 Thank you video games 
What about
inside my brain 
 Craig Inside your brain 
it s a little tougher
to really tell 
We would expect
that any effect of this
is going to be small 
I mean we couldn t take
your hippocampus
and make it twice as big
because then it would
have to be pushing
something else out 
So it s just not going
to be a large change 
So where we did find
a difference
is actually in the shape
of the hippocampus 
What we saw is
there were some regions
in the hippocampus
on both sides
that appear
to have changed shape
from day one before gaming
to day ten after gaming 
What s really surprising to me
is that as an adult 
my brain is still changing 
That makes me wanna take
better care of my brain 
Yes 
Exercise it more 
 cause it is a thing
that can change 
I m not just stuck
with what I have now today 
I mean in all of this 
I think that the big takeaway
is that doing things 
giving your brain
something to learn 
something to do 
something to figure out 
this is what we think
is actually
keeping your brain sharp 
One way to do that is to keep
watching Mind Field 
 Craig Exactly 
 Michael As our relationship
with technology becomes
ever stronger 
people are bound to worry about
what it will do to our brains 
Will offloading memory
and computing
to our machines make us dumber 
Will our empathy for machines
have negative consequences
for how we interact
with each other 
Well let s look back
to another time
a new kind of technology
threatened
to fundamentally
change our brains 
Two and a half thousand
years ago 
the Greek philosopher Socrates 
worried that
the wide use of writing
would have a negative impact
on people s minds 
He said that writing would 
to quote his student Plato 
Create forgetfulness 
because people will
not use their memories 
They will trust the external
written characters
and not remember themselves 
Socrates was right 
Written language did
fundamentally change our brains 
But it s also one of
the cornerstones of everything
modern civilization
has accomplished 
One of the defining
characteristics of being human
is that this is not
the boundary of my body 
and this is not the boundary
of my mind 
And as always 
thanks for watching 
﻿ soft dramatic music 
 Hi I m Michael Stevens 
but who are you 
Do you even know who you are 
Are you your memories 
 I don t remember that 
 I don t remember that at all 
 Are you the choices you make 
The focus tester
is actually a magician 
 That s scary 
 chuckles 
 Or are you your past 
 I hit the back of my head
and I forgot my entire life 
Just like you hit
a delete button on a computer 
 quietly

Have you ever looked
at a photograph of yourself
and thought 
That s what I look like 
We often think we look bad
or not right in photos
because photos show us
what we really look like
to other people 
The you that
you re used to seeing
is mirror you 
Every mirror you look into
reverses your face 
Most selfie cameras do this too 
so we tend to prefer
that version of ourselves 
If you wanna see yourself
in a mirror
the way other people see you
in real life 
take two mirrors
and position them
at a degree angle 
What you see won t be
yourself reversed 
but how you look in real life 
So who would you say
you are really 
Is it how you look 
Or is it how you dress 
Or are you the atoms
that make you up 
Because all of those things
change throughout your life 
Ah maybe
the real common thread 
that which doesn t change 
is your history 
your memory 
But what if we remember things
differently
from the way
they actually happened 
Does that mean
we don t know ourselves 
False memories are
frighteningly easy to create 
Today we re gonna make some 
and we re gonna have
a little fun doing it 
We have created a fake game show
called Who You Were 
We re gonna bring contestants
down memory lane
and have them tell us
about their past 
Some of which we re going
to completely make up 
We re gonna plant a few
little seeds in this mind field
and see if we can grow
some fake memories 
 cheers and applause 
Hi I m Michael Stevens 
and welcome to the show
that takes you on a trip
from who you are
all the way back through 
Who You Were 
Please welcome
today s very special guest 
Timothy DeLaGhetto 
 How s it going man 
 Thanks for coming in 
 Thanks for having me 
 Excited to kinda
dive into some memories 
 Yeah I don t really know
what to expect 
 To begin though 
let s give the audience
a taste of your life 
 Oh my God let s take a look 
 So Tim was raised
in California
where he and his parents
owned and operated
a Thai food restaurant 
 laughing 
 Tim found popularity
as a rapper 
comedian actor 
and Internet personality 
and has attracted
over million subscribers 
In order to to kind of see
how you became who you are today
let s go back to who you were 
 Let s do it 
 We spoke to your parents 
 Mm hmm 
 And they told us
some of their favorite memories
from when you were very 
very young 
 I m going to start
with some true stories
before I slip in
the false memory 
When you were seven 
you were pretty much
held prisoner
by a very controlling
school girl 
The girl took control
of your life
and always wanted to know
what you were doing 
 I remember her 
Like she was 
like my my best friend 
sort of 
but then she was also very 
like possessive of me 
 But you guys aren t
together still 
 No we might be
Facebook friends 
Here s a memory 
You weren t a crybaby
on the first day of school 
 Yeah 
 Until you noticed that
all the other kids were crying
and then you joined in 
 You know 
I empathize with people 
 Right 
 And uh I was just kind of 
like helping them feel like
we were all a team 
 Now here s the fake story
we made up out of thin air 
Here s another memory 
 When you were about
four or five years old 
 Mm kay 
 You actually took a ride
in a hot air balloon 
but you dropped something
from the balloon 
 laughs 
 Really 
 Yeah like at all 
 We re going deep far back 
 I didn t even know
I ve ever been in
a hot air balloon
until you just reminded me 
 It was in Echo Park 
 Was it 
 No clue 
 Timothy is not accepting
the story as truth yet 
Time for our second subject 
 xylophone trills 
 upbeat music 
 Dylan how are you 
 I m doing great man 
 You were uh inseparable
from you Superman cape
when you were young 
Once you even tried
to use your super powers
to stop a car
driving down the street 
 Yeah try to stop a car 
like with my with my hand
and everything 
 Did you succeed 
the dude hit his brakes 
 Okay next memory 
So when you were about
four or five years old 
you took a ride
in a hot air balloon
and you dropped something 
 Huh 
Uh 
I m not sure
if I remember that to be honest 
 Sometimes enriching
the false story
with a realistic detail
can trigger the brain
to begin filling in the memory 
Here goes 
Did you have a favorite toy
or anything
that maybe you had brought 
 Oh I mean I had like 
some action figures I think 
Um I do remember 
like losing one 
I m not sure like that was 
like the what happened 
If I uh was
in a hot air balloon 
That s a crazy adventure
if I actually 
like did something like that 
 Hi Victoria 
When you were around
 Four or five years old 
Up in the air 
 How many times you been
in a hot air balloon 
 None 
 Of course
none of the subjects
remember the balloon ride 
It never happened 
but we are not done
with them yet 
 hours from now 
we ll take our subjects
to Echo Park 
 The site of their supposed
childhood balloon ride 
to see if any of
the seeds I planted today
have taken root 
This is where you took
your first hot air balloon ride 
 Are you serious 
 I m serious 
 soft dramatic music 
We might not be able
to remember our past accurately
all the time 
but at least we have
direct insight
into our own mental states 
We know how we feel 
what we like 
and why 
Except we don t 
Psychologists call
our tendency to overvalue
how we explain our own behavior
while distrusting
that other people
truly understand their own 
An interesting manifestation
of this bias
is something called 
It is surprisingly easy
to fool someone into believing
they made a choice
that they never did 
and the amazing thing is that
they ll also defend
that fake choice
as if it were
what they had always wanted 
 film reel humming 
We feel like
we know ourselves pretty well 
We know why
we like the things we like 
We know why we decided
to do the things that we did 
But do we 
 dramatic music 
Today we ll be showing
our subjects sets of photos
and asking them
to choose the photo
of the person
they d prefer to work with 
But this isn t exactly
what it looks like 
is actually a magician
who will be using
slight of hand
to swap
some of the faces they choose
for faces they ve rejected 
Will they catch the trick 
Or will they justify
and explain a decision
they never actually made 
 Thank you for participating
in this study
of first impressions
in the workplace 
You will be shown sets of faces
and be asked to select
which person you would prefer
to work with 
Are you ready to begin 
 I am yes 
 Cool 
So would you rather
work with person A 
or person B 
 Person B 
That s as complex as it gets 
 laughs 
I can do this 
 Person A or Person B 
 Uh B 
B 
A 
 Perfect 
So we ve made a pile of
your ideal workplace colleagues 
Effectively 
 Uh now part two is to 
if you could fill out the
women in the workplace
segment of the questionnaire 
 All of this business
about filling out a survey 
it s just to distract them
from what s about to happen
because our magician
is gonna make a swap 
Two of the eight photos
have been swapped out
for pictures
our subject rejected 
What will she say
when presented
with photos of people
she didn t actually choose 
 Now on their own merits 
I wanna ask you
what it was about them
that made you pick them 
 We ll start with a picture
that she did pick
before we slip in the rejects 
 So why did you want
to work with this person 
 She looks nice 
She looks really nice 
but I think the person
I compared her to
didn t look very friendly 
 Gotcha 
 Here s another pair of photos
where she had
a clear preference 
 Now we re going to show her
the picture
she actually rejected 
 Why did you want
to work with this person 
 Um she just looked nicer
than the other one 
 That was one
where the other girl
didn t look very nice at all 
 Is she just misremembering
this one choice 
How about another photo
she rejected 
 Why did you prefer
 She looks super sweet 
 So that was
what you were thinking
when you chose that chose her 
I feel like she would be
one of those girls
that would like 
on the birthdays
get you the card and 
She just looks really sweet 
 This isn t just
simple misremembering 
This is fabricating
a past that never happened 
Will any of our other subjects
justify choices
that they never made 
 A 
 Now we ll present him
with the photo he rejected 
 So why did you choose
 She gave off the appearance
of a genuine person
who would be easy to work with 
 People are
completely fabricating
justifications
for things they never even did 
I think we could actually
up the ante 
We ve been swapping
two of the eight faces 
now we ll swap four 
Let s see if she justifies
the photos
that she actually rejected 
 I liked her her look 
I like to work
with confidant people 
so to me she looked like
a confident person 
As a woman 
I wanna like 
help other women
grow and succeed
and give them advice
and I gravitated
towards that picture
because of that reason 
She looked like a type of person
you could confide in
and ask advice and learn
from her experiences 
So I think she had
that type of look 
She looks like she might be 
like a wise type of person 
She looks confident 
So I think that s
why I picked her 
 She seems so sure
of her decisions 
but let s give her
one last look 
 In particular 
I m curious about how you feel
about these four 
there s the confidence
and um kindness 
and somebody young 
I feel like that would be
people I could work with so 
I I stand by my decisions 
 Yes laughs 
 The interesting thing
about this study 
 Is they are not actually
the ones you chose 
 No 
 These ones were 
 Oh 
 They were switched
while you were filling in
the questionnaire 
It s this phenomenon 
what s known as
choice blindness 
If we think we made a choice 
we will find a way
to justify that choice 
 Ah 
 Even if we don t know
that s what we made 
I was trying to justify
these four 
 Cause I forgot
that I picked those four 
 It s like a debate 
Like no matter what 
what side I was on 
I was gonna give reasons
for that 
I m uh I m not happy
that I did that 
but um that s the reason why 
 You pulled this
complete switcheroo on me 
and I wasn t even 
like conscious about it 
That s scary 
 You may think you know
why you do the things you do 
but in a pinch 
your mind can replace the truth 
that actual past
with completely new explanations
that you will
confidently believe
to be exactly what happened 
But what if fabricating the past
is all you can do 
That may be the case
for someone with 
When you can t
remember your life at all 
what happens
to your sense of self 
So Scott you have
retrograde amnesia 
 Correct 
 Tell me what that is 
how it happened 
 I walked into a restroom
at my office building 
but I slipped on
an oily substance 
and hit the back of my head
and suffered you know 
it was like four 
or five inch laceration 
and that gave me
retrograde amnesia 
which means everything
autobiographical
and historical in my life
were completely erased 
 Erased 
 Just like you hit
I ve forgotten my entire life 
I had no idea who my wife was 
Her name 
my children 
It was absolutely horrifying 
 Wow 
So this happened
eight years ago 
 What memories did you have 
You still knew English 
You still knew things
like how to ride a bike 
That s a totally different
both Right 
 Well when I handed him
a toothbrush 
he didn t comb his hair with it 
He put it in his mouth 
but he didn t know
what it was called 
 And you didn t remember
ever using one before 
 But you didn t have
the autobiographical memories
that involved toothbrushes 
but you knew how to operate it
 cause that s
a procedural memory 
 Exactly exactly 
 Things like that 
you know are stored in
a different part of the brain 
 So it was almost like
you were you were born
into this person s body
you didn t get to choose 
You have a name 
you have a wife 
you have a house 
you have a past 
 And you have to just accept
that all of those
are what you ve been dealt 
 Right cause that s exactly
how I felt 
Like I stepped
into somebody else s life 
and 
a lot of it I didn t believe 
I just couldn t picture that 
you know I flew airplanes
or or was in the NFL 
I just seemed like
nothing I would ever do 
and a lot of it you know 
she had to prove to me 
She put together
a whole album full of pictures 
She kind of put my life
in a chronological order 
 And that kind of you know 
filled some of the gaps
of who I was 
and I I ve heard that 
you are who you are
from the things
you ve experienced
and your memories 
and when I hear that 
it s like a knife in my heart 
 Cause it s like 
Then who am I 
 So Scott when you re asked 
Who are you 
what do you say 
 It s hard to answer
that question
because I haven t
figured out who I am 
I m developing every day
my personality and who I am 
but inside of my brain 
I don t know who I am 
 You are the collection
of all of your memories 
Right 
I mean that s your story 
Those are things
that happened to you
and they re in the past 
They can t be changed 
But it can be created 
An illuminating Harvard study
found numerous examples
of seemingly sane people
who believed
they had recovered memories
of past lives
and alien abductions 
and there s no deceit 
These people actually believe
that these events occurred 
 And I remember I was
just literally scared to death 
 Once people have decided
that a memory is real 
the brain can fill in details
that never happened 
Especially
if the clues you re getting
or what people are telling you
isn t entirely accurate 
Leading cognitive psychologist
Elizabeth Loftus
made that point
in a experiment
where she convinced
over of the subjects
that they had been lost
in a shopping mall as a child 
Your brain will just take
those untruths and run with them
and fill in details
out of nowhere 
Completely changing
your personal history 
When we last saw
our Who You Were subjects 
they did not recall
the false memory we planted 
When you were about
but you dropped something 
 I m not sure
 You took a ride
 We ve let the memory
sink in over night 
and today we re gonna see
if physical stimuli
will help solidify this story
in their minds 
Today is all about you 
 And a little drive
down your memory lane 
 This is where
you rode over
In a hot air balloon 
 That s right 
 Maybe my parents mistaked me
for like a another kid 
 Some other kid 
 We ll get out and walk around
and see what can come back 
Let it all soak in 
and tell me
if anything s
coming back to you 
 Hmm 
I don t know man 
It s not it s not popping up 
 You dropped something 
 breathes deeply 
 When you were
in this hot air balloon 
Will this be the detail
that pushes Tim
to remember the event 
 What could I have dropped 
What did I walk around with
back then 
 I spent another minutes
attempting
to kick start Tim s brain
with details
of the false balloon story 
Has anything come back 
 Tim s brain
doesn t seem susceptible
to the false memory 
Let s check in
with our other subjects 
your hot air balloon ride 
This is Echo Park 
 And 
 It was about years ago 
 You don t remember any 
anything from this 
 Of course he doesn t 
It never happened 
 This is 
 This is it yeah 
Does this bring back memories 
 Um 
 You don t remember anything
from this 
I do remember 
like something as a kid 
I I dropped something 
 He dropped something 
Now how do you suppose
he got that idea 
You dropped something 
Dylan s mind
is gradually taking
an idea we planted
and adopting it
as his own memory detail 
 I could have been around here
riding my bike 
then we took
a hot air balloon ride 
and possibly dropped
a Superman cape 
 For some people 
physical sensations can be
an effective trigger
to bring back real
or imaginary memories 
What about smells and sounds 
 Well when I was
four or five when I was here 
I remember it smelling 
fresh 
 This sensory memory
may be a jumping off point
to begin accepting
You remember looking down
on the park from above 
 I might remember um 
Being able
to overlook the water 
Um 
I remember like standing over
and squatting 
and like 
just li 
being so happy to be up there
and the wind
blowing my hair back 
and my dad kept
telling me to sit down 
and I wouldn t sit down 
 Yeah you weren t scared 
 How high up were you 
 Probably like 
 feet 
 No kidding 
Victoria s false memory
is beginning to take hold
with the help of her
imaginative subconscious brain 
What do you remember seeing
from up in the hot air balloon 
 The water fountain 
for sure 
 Yeah 
 And I could have been crazy 
but I think
that I could have felt 
like almost a little bit
of mist hit my skin
from the water fountain 
 What color was the balloon 
 I wanna say it was red 
 Red 
Let s see if
the seed I planted earlier
has taken hold 
You took a ride
 You dropped something 
 I did 
At that age 
I was a huge Barney fan 
 And I just like remember
just like and looking down
and him just being gone 
 laughs About where
did it fall do you think 
 Um I would say
six or seven blocks away 
 Oh really 
So not in the water 
 By now 
it seems Victoria s brain
has turned our suggested memory
into a complete
childhood experience 
 I remember
waking up at like 
 in the morning 
getting in the car 
and then my mom and I
being in the car
having no idea
where we were going
 cause he loved to do that 
Just put the family in the car
and just go somewhere 
and just like surprise us 
 Victoria is personalizing
this false memory
by merging it
with pleasant details
from her childhood 
 And next thing you know like 
we re just like flying over 
like the whole 
like greater Los Angeles area 
 So who do you think was
in the basket with you 
 Well definitely
both my parents 
I know we got something
to eat afterwards 
Almost I wanna say like 
a churro or something like that 
 Post balloon churro 
 laughs Yeah 
 It s a classic 
 Now that
our subjects are convinced
that the balloon ride
happened 
 Oh shit 
 It s time
for a reality check 
Tell your mom uh the memory 
 We went like 
on a hot air balloon ride 
and I dropped 
I think my Superman cape 
Why you looking like that 
No Dylan 
That never happened 
 Wait what 
 There was never
a balloon ride 
 We made the whole story up 
Well you made most of it up 
 Oh wow 
 But isn t that amazing 
Because remember 
we planted that story 
 No that is 
That s actually really crazy 
I I was actually having these 
these like 
weird faint memories
of me like looking over 
like the pond 
and like you know 
I don t even know 
 Has Dylan been
to Echo Park before 
 And now it s Victoria s turn
for a rude awakening
from her father 
 Hi 
 The story is not true 
 What 
 You ve never been
 What re you guys
talking about 
Why would you make that up 
 Did you truly believe
that you d been
 You remembered
so many details 
 Of something
 So what were you remembering 
 I m not entirely sure
because I really do
feel like I have a memory 
 We all are susceptible
to this 
 I really felt like I had
experienced that experience 
 And what about our YouTuber 
Tim 
 Well Tim I ll tell you what 
It s not surprising
that you don t remember
anything from it 
 Cause it never happened 
 I knew it 
I was like Dude 
 Tim wasn t susceptible 
But false memories are common
and can have
real world implications 
The innocence Project
of the United States claims
that faulty
eye witness memories
account for of convictions
overturned by DNA evidence 
So who are you 
Well how could you be
any one thing 
You are always changing 
If you can lose track
of your past 
and your memories
can be altered
or implanted 
in the end 
who are you really 
Maybe 
you re the stories
you re telling yourself 
and as always 
﻿ sneezes Excuse me 
You know 
if I had been driving 
that would ve been
pretty dangerous 
Every time you sneeze 
your eyes close
for about one second 
which means if you sneeze
while driving at say 
 miles per hour times 
divided by divided by 
you will travel about feet
with your eyes closed 
But don t worry 
This is a self driving car 
It uses sensors and software
to drive itself
to keep me
and other people safe 
I hope 
 tires screech 
Impressive 
But let me ask you a question 
What if an autonomous vehicle
had to make a choice
between hitting two people
right in front of it
or swerving to avoid them
and hit one person
on a sidewalk 
What should
it be programmed to do 
 tires screech car crashes 
What would you do 
Now polls and surveys
have been put together
asking people what they think
they would do 
but no researchers
have ever put people
in that actual
traumatic experience 
Would we learn more about
human nature if we did that 
Would it even be ethical to put
people in that sort of position 
I m about to find out 
In British philosopher
Philippa Foot
created a precursor to our
self driving car conundrum 
The famous scenario
she came up with
is known as
the trolley problem 
Imagine there s a runaway train
hurtling down a train track 
Directly ahead of the train 
there are five people
on the track 
Now imagine that you are
too far away
to help those five people 
but right next to you 
there s a lever that can divert
the train onto another track 
If you divert the train 
the five people will be saved 
But here s the catch 
There s another person
on the second track 
Now you re faced with a dilemma 
You can either do nothing
and the train
will kill five people 
or you can pull the lever
and save their lives 
but be directly responsible
for one person s death 
When surveyed most people say
that they d pull the lever
and sacrifice one person
to save five 
It s for the greater good 
But how we say we d act
may not match
how we d actually act if
the scenario really happened
with real emotions
and real lives at stake 
Any difference between the two
would reveal who we are
compared to who we want to be 
but a comparison
could only be made by doing
what has never been done before 
making the trolley problem real 
 Michael Suppose we conducted
an experiment
in a realistic railroad
switching station
with test subjects
watching trains on monitors 
The trains and the people
on the tracks
would be staged
and prerecorded 
but the subjects would think
it was all real 
They would believe that
they could control a lever
that switches the tracks 
and they d have the option
to divert the train or not 
They d be totally convinced
that they have to choose
between five lives or one 
But wait 
there s a greater good dilemma
about doing an experiment
on the greater good 
By forcing people
to truly believe
they might kill someone 
are we risking
serious psychological damage
to them 
Yes it might be beneficial to
all of us to see what happens 
but would those benefits be
worth potential trauma to a few 
To actually conduct
a real life trolley problem 
I needed to make sure
it would be ethical 
So I sat down
with behavioral neuroscientist
Professor Aaron Blaisdell 
What you know about
the trolley problem
and what previous studies
have found 
Most people say
they would pull the switch 
Sure it s one life versus five 
The math works out 
But what I want to know
is that if we actually
put them in front
of a switch watching a train
barreling towards people 
would they actually pull it
in that moment 
I bet a lot of them
would freeze
in that moment 
When you re afraid 
I think that shuts down
a lot of action 
 I d like to find out 
 Okay 
What potential harms could come
to someone in that position 
Most people
would probably be fine 
but there is
a small potential for harm
in the sense of somebody
being guilt ridden
over their decision 
obsessive thoughts about 
I m the person
who would push that button
and cause the train to go
and kill somebody 
Or they might think 
who would freeze
and I wouldn t be able
and that could be traumatic 
Have we ever tested
on human subjects for real 
To my knowledge 
we have not 
Would you want to see
enacted in real life 
You know I would 
That would be
very informative about
how people really react 
 If I were tell you
we re going to run this 
 would you feel comfortable
with that responsibility
on your shoulders 
No I couldn t do it 
For me
to be involved in that 
it would have to be on
the shoulders of many people 
including an ethics board 
I couldn t just
go through with that 
Dr Blaisdell s reliance
on an ethics board made sense 
Most universities
have ethics review boards
to answer
one crucial question 
When is it okay to risk
psychological harm
in the name of science 
 Narrator 
It is May 
An experiment is being
conducted at Yale University 
 Michael Ethics review boards
were developed as a result
of some controversial
psychological experiments
of the last century 
One theory is that people
learn things correctly
whenever they get punished
for making a mistake 
 buzzer 
 Incorrect 
You ll now get a shock
of volts 
 man grunts 
Dr Stanley Milgram
tested
how far subjects would go
in obeying authority 
even if they believed
they were physically
hurting someone 
 volts 
 man screams 
No one was being electrocuted 
and the screams
of the shock victim were fake 
but the trauma
that the participants suffered
was very real 
 man You have no right
to hold me here 
Let me out 
This sparked controversy
within
the scientific community 
Many questioned
Milgram s methodology 
but unlike a research school 
Mind Field doesn t answer
to a university s
ethics committee 
That said 
I wanted to get the thoughts
of an institutional
review board 
so I tracked one down
and proposed my idea
for doing the trolley problem
in real life 
Do you think I could reach
a point where you would
feel comfortable
approving this study 
I hate to be the bearer
of bad tidings Michael 
Probably not 
I m not ready to say no
quite yet 
I would love
to see your study pass 
and I actually think
the ways to make it pass
is we should probably
be screening out for people
who might have posttraumatic
stress disorder 
you know any kind of 
like clinical problem
that could make them
more vulnerable
to a type of event like this
with the addition of something
like a trauma counselor on site 
I actually think
that under those circumstances 
 it might pass 
 Can you present
a compelling case as to
the social good of this study 
 I agree 
 If you could find a way
to say Look 
this is why it s important 
It s not just basic
theoretical research 
This has direct implications
for mass transit 
direct implications
for self driving cars 
It s a risk benefit 
but the benefits
are potentially tremendous 
Right and so my hope
is that the good
this experiment does
is in revealing
the difference
between instinct
and philosophical reflection 
and I think that there
could be an enormous benefit
in learning the difference
so that we can train people
to act in the way
that they wish they would 
 David Yeah 
 Natasha That s interesting 
 That s a compelling argument 
 Natasha Yeah 
I came into this meeting
expecting a lot of resistance 
but instead I m actually
leaving invigorated 
like excited to take
their concerns 
implement them into the study 
and make it not just
more acceptable 
which I thought
was the purpose here 
but to actually make it
more beneficial 
more fascinating 
and penetrate deeper
and have more applications
in society 
So I decided we were ready
to move forward 
to turn one
of the most notorious
hypothetical ethical dilemmas
into a reality 
 train horn blowing 
We traveled
to an abandoned railroad line
and hired a freight train 
Our subjects needed to be shown
how switch points work 
So the Mind Field 
production team
shot a video of a train
going down two tracks 
Then we dressed six actors
like railroad workers 
Since we didn t want them
to be at actual risks of harm 
we took steps to make sure
they were safe 
You re all going to be
workers on the track 
We will not have
the train moving
while you are on the tracks 
 Michael We filmed
our actors on the tracks 
wearing ear protection
and looking distracted
to explain
why they couldn t hear
a train coming toward them 
Then in editing 
we employed visual effects
to create the illusion
of the train approaching 
We then combined
the shots together 
During the experiment 
we would play the video
for our subjects 
who would believe
the action was happening live
and transmitted
from remote cameras 
Our next step
was to find an expert
who would be willing to guide
me through the process
of selecting our subjects 
in order to minimize
psychological harm 
So what should I be
worried about 
The worst would probably be
posttraumatic stress disorder 
and that s when
they re going to be
re experiencing the trauma 
They ll keep thinking
about it over and over 
and so to limit risk you d
want to screen out people
prone to
a traumatic reaction 
and then afterwards 
do the debrief 
That s the key
to limit harm
from happening 
How are they feeling
at this moment 
What s going on with them 
You can start to ease them
into the reality
of what is
instead of what they
thought it was 
Would you be willing to help us
conduct this experiment 
Oh uh 
yes I mean 
I think I would 
I think this is
a really fascinating
and valuable experiment 
because people can have
very uncomfortable lessons that
they then start to learn from 
If I can make sure
that we get people
who may be appropriate
to do such a thing 
I would be honored 
 woman I m calling regarding
a study we re doing
for high speed railway 
I wanted to know if you
might be interested
in participating next week 
To disguise the true nature
of our experiment 
we placed an online ad
recruiting people
for a fake focus group
to offer feedback
on California s
new high speed rail 
Today I m just going to ask you
to fill out a couple forms
to make sure that there s
a range of personality types
in our group
and for TSA security purposes 
These psychological surveys 
used frequently by employers 
look to uncover signs
of depression anxiety 
and other conditions
that might make someone
unsuitable to participate
in this experiment 
Thank you very much 
Have a great day 
Thank you 
Back in Dr Cason s office 
we reviewed the potential
subjects responses 
This particular person 
I was concerned about this 
Some high suicidal thinking 
high acting out 
Those kinds
of factors might not be
good in an experiment
where you want
to try to prevent
 some of the trauma
 Right 
These people though 
and there s
a large group of them 
they are more resilient 
So I would be more comfortable
with these people 
because their ability
to bounce back
in difficult situations
might make them
less susceptible
to a trauma 
 Michael Finally after
consulting two psychologists
and a university ethics board 
it was time to put our plan
into action 
 Michael This is where we re
going to physically create
not with a trolley 
but with a train 
Our subjects will sign in
at this booth
for our phony focus test 
which will never
actually take place 
It s going to be
a hot day for them 
So we ll offer them 
while they wait
for the actual test to begin 
the chance to sit inside
this nice air conditioned
remote switching station 
Inside they ll meet a kindly
train switch operator 
supposedly an employee
of the California
Railroad Authority 
The California Railroad
Authority is real 
Real fake 
We invented this nonexistent
government organization
to convince our subjects
that everything here is real 
including these monitors
showing supposedly live shots
of actual trains
from different tracks
all around the California area 
 horn blows 
While the participant
is waiting inside this room 
they ll learn how the operator
switches the tracks
using a lever to remotely
switch a train
from one track to another 
They ll see it happen 
We re actually controlling
the video
on these screens from
a different hidden control room 
At a given time 
the switch operator
will leave the subject alone
in the switching station 
And at that point 
a crisis will occur 
 brakes hiss 
 horn blows 
A train will be barreling
down the tracks 
and workers will have made
their way out to both tracks 
five on one one worker
on his phone on the other 
No one is around for them
to alert
who has any kind of control
or authority 
Switching the train is up
to the subject alone 
They ll feel like what they do
has real world consequences 
 train horn blows 
 Will five people die 
or will one 
Our first participant
is almost here 
so it s time for me
to get ready 
Dr Cason 
how are you feeling 
 Good 
 My hypothesis
is that we re going see
people immediately 
when they hear
that first warning 
leave the station and not want
to get back inside 
The other option
would be of course 
the freeze action 
where
they don t do anything 
 cause they don t know
what to do 
In that case 
we want to know
their thought process 
It ll be interesting
to see This has never
been done before 
All right well here we go 
 warning bells clanging 
Our first subject is Elsa 
 woman Do you wanna stand
over here in the shade 
Hi I m Elsa 
nice to meet you 
Nice to meet you Elsa 
Everyone she meets is an actor 
and all of our cameras
are hidden
so she has no idea
that she s being watched 
Oh yeah 
thank you so much 
and then my phone
if I can 
 Michael Our subjects were
told that the technology
they re about to see
is proprietary 
This gave us an excuse
to collect their phones
so they couldn t call for help
during the imminent crisis 
 Thank you so much
for coming out today 
 Thank you 
What we re doing here is 
the California Railroad
Authority 
they re developing
high speed trains 
And so we want the public
to come in and give us
some feedback on how
comfortable they are 
the decor you know 
 Oh wow 
 All that kind of stuff 
 cell phone chirps 
 Um oh shoot 
They re running a little
behind from the last one 
 That s okay 
 So it s just gonna be like 
another maybe minutes 
Yeah that s fine yeah 
No problem 
Um you know what 
I ve got an idea 
Michael 
Now Elsa believes
she has to wait
for minutes 
 knock on door 
 Yeah 
Our actress pretends
to ask permission
for her to wait inside
the switching station 
So actually 
this isn t part of it 
This is a remote
train switching station 
but since it s gonna be
a little bit 
and it s
nice and cool and
air conditioned in there 
I just talked to Eddie 
and he said
it would be totally great
for you to come in 
 Oh yeah okay 
 and just check it out 
 Okay cool 
 and see what they
do in there 
Eddie this is Elsa 
 How are you Elsa 
 I m good how are you 
Good come on in 
have a seat 
So what brings you out this way 
Um the focus group 
Focus group 
Yes the high speed railroad 
The luxury railroad 
Okay So what we got here is
a remote switching station 
These are all live feeds 
What s happening is there s
a lot of construction going on 
We re going to have to put
all new ballast through here 
new ribbon rail
right here on these 
 Michael In case you re
wondering we hired an actor
who actually spent years
working on railroads 
Can you imagine if we had
an actor who didn t know
a lot about trains 
 Greg 
He offers something
called face validity
in that you can look him 
and you think 
Ah this guy s real 
My job here is to
take care of all the switching
right here on these
two tracks right now 
And so there needs to be someone
in here all the time 
Now the other thing
about this 
 female voice 
Attention train approaching 
This is probably
a work unit that s coming 
 Uh huh 
 We re gonna divert it
to track two 
Okay so a train s coming 
Now s a chance for her
to learn how the switch works 
Ah very good 
In fact why don t you be
the one to do that 
Just go ahead
and throw it yourself 
 Pull it down 
 Right now 
Yeah go ahead Good 
It s going much faster
than you think 
All right it s gonna
make the transition
to track number two 
Well I tell you what 
You re now a switchman 
 both laugh 
Okay well 
now that the trailing car
is clear of the switch points 
go ahead and switch it back
to track one 
 That was kind of scary 
I was like oh my gosh 
I have to turn it 
Well just you wait 
The good thing is we ve got it
back on line one 
and that means
that the next train
that comes through
will go through on track one 
Elsa now understands exactly
where the trains will go 
switch one to the left 
switch two to the right 
It was time to force her to
make a very difficult decision 
 cell phone rings 
 Hang on 
 Oh I gotta take this 
 Oh yeah sure no problem 
Do me a favor 
 Wait right here 
Someone has to be here
at all times 
Okay no problem 
I m just gonna go out
and take care of this 
 Okay no problem Okay 
 Be back in a sec 
Look at her eyes
 cause she s concerned
immediately 
a little worried 
like What 
 Michael We gave Elsa
a couple of minutes
to acclimate
to her surroundings and then 
we started the playback
of our staged footage 
 Michael All right 
here come the workers 
Attention object on track 
Yep she just noticed them 
She s looking
in her purse to find 
 Michael No phone 
 no phone 
I think the warning
does a lot 
If you re in that station 
you re supposed to do something 
Okay here comes the train 
 train horn blows 
Here s the train approaching 
warning 
I don t think at this 
oh there she goes 
There s a train approaching 
 woman What 
I wanted to let him know that
there s a train approaching 
 Oh my God okay 
 Can you tell him 
Yeah I will go look for him
right now 
But the switch operator
won t be coming back 
The full weight of this crisis
is all on Elsa 
 Whoa whoa whoa 
 Attention object on track 
 Attention train approaching 
 Greg I can t believe this 
End of test 
Everyone is safe 
 Michael We didn t want
the participants to think
that anyone actually got hurt 
So we showed them this
everyone is safe card
before the train would have
actually hit anyone 
 Elsa 
 I m Michael 
 Hi 
 And this is Greg 
 This was all an experiment 
Can we come on in 
We want to ask you
a few questions 
Yeah sure 
Did I do something wrong 
 Not at all 
 How are you feeling right now 
Um just scared 
 Go ahead and take a seat 
 Greg Scared 
 Yes 
 So no one was in any danger 
This is a psychological
experiment that we re conducting
on how people behave
when decisions need to be made 
 Oh okay 
 Walk me through how you felt 
I felt the pressure 
I m like Oh my gosh 
these people are gonna die 
I had to make a very quick
and sound decision like 
immediately right now 
right this second 
Their lives were in my hands 
I need to change it
 Michael What was motivating
your decision to switch 
So I can save more lives 
I didn t know if I was
making the right decision 
I mean 
a life is a life right 
 Michael So when confronted
with two terrible choices 
at least one person
was capable of taking
deliberate action to sacrifice
one in order to save five 
But we wanted to see
if Elsa s reaction was typical 
 Need my phone 
 Yes please 
Would you be interested
in high speed transportation 
 Oh yeah anything
that cuts through 
Shoot sorry I just got a text 
I m so sorry 
Why don t you have
a look in there
and see the trains running 
Oh it s
so much nicer in here
than it is out there 
When I first started out I used
to have to stand out in the sun 
 What 
 Do you know when
the next train s coming 
 There s one coming
right there 
 He has a great eye 
 Michael As with Elsa 
every subject received a lesson
in how to switch the tracks 
Why don t you go ahead
and switch them 
 Right here 
 Yeah 
Go ahead 
How does that feel 
I was like exhilarated 
I was like I got nervous 
 One second 
Let me check this 
Hang on one sec Ah 
Someone has to be in here
the whole time 
 I got it yep I m here 
 Hello 
 laughing 
Breaker one nine 
roger copy that 
He s actually
tapping into the power
of being in that position 
Here comes the test 
She s not moving 
 Just watch his eyebrows 
 Michael Oh yeah 
Eyes are going
back and forth 
Train approaching 
 Oh she s worried 
I don t know what I would do
in this kind of scenario 
This is sort of that
frozen pose that we see 
Paralysis in the face of danger
is such a common reaction 
Object on track 
 Michael Even with the train
seconds away 
some are still looking
for others to take control 
I ll go try
and find him Okay 
 sings softly 
 She s singing 
This is self soothing
there yeah 
Object on track Attention 
 She s not moving 
 Oh my gosh wow 
 Okay 
 Is she gonna switch it 
Attention 
 All right let s go 
 Michael Not one of these
participants pulled the lever 
Time to find out why 
 Michael Hello J R 
Oh my gosh 
How you guys doing 
 My name s Michael 
 J R 
Everything that just happened
was an experiment 
This was an experiment 
 Oh my gosh 
What were you feeling
when you were watching that 
Terrified I I just 
I was feeling
a little anxious
when I saw
the train coming 
like Oh my God 
 Your heart is beating fast 
 Yeah a little bit yeah 
Tell me what was going
through your mind when you heard
that first warning
that a train was approaching 
I thought
about switching it 
but then
actually acting on it
was a different thing 
I kind of suspended
my responsibility 
Like I didn t
know what to do 
so I was just like 
Oh I better not
touch it you know 
because I don t know
if I ll
screw something up 
I would assume
that there would be 
out of those five guys 
someone would ve looked back 
They were gonna get
out of the way 
of the train was already
planning to stop 
I think they probably built
those trains
with some type of sensor
or something like that 
 Michael The train
probably had sensors 
The workers would ve noticed 
I didn t want to touch
the equipment 
These are all forms
of attribution 
when an individual assumes
that others
are either responsible
for taking action
or have already done so 
 Both tracks
had people on them 
 Right 
And I just didn t know who
should live and who should die 
Do I switch it 
do I not switch it 
I mean either way 
someone s gonna get
really badly hurt 
I didn t want that power 
It was quite 
quite the test I would say 
It is quite the test 
one subject
had switched the tracks 
and five others had not 
But we weren t done yet 
Meet Cory 
 Here have a seat 
 Much obliged thank you 
This whole module
will interconnect
with the entire nation
if we wanted it to 
But right now we re looking
at just track one on the left 
track two through there 
 Nice 
 These are many 
many miles away 
 Yeah 
 But they re all live feeds 
Surveying the scene 
Eagle s point of view 
 Yeah Let me see what this is 
 Okay I ll be right back 
 Okay got it 
He s remaining engaged 
Here come the workers 
Oh no 
Uh yeah 
So he realizes there s
a potential problem 
I think
he s gonna go out 
Um there s a train coming 
 Greg Okay 
Okay he realizes there s
no one there it s urgent 
Okay 
so this needs to go to 
 Greg Okay he s
rehearsing what to do 
 Oh Track two 
Do they not know 
I know 
They should see this 
 Oh my God 
 End of test 
 Okay good 
 Hi Cory my name s Michael 
There was just a 
almost an accident
seemingly 
 Cory everything that just
happened was an experiment 
 No one was in danger 
 For sure 
These were just loops
of video taken before 
This is a psychology experiment
looking at how people behave 
 Okay Okay yeah 
 in various circumstances 
So tell me
how you were feeling 
 Mainly a bunch of terror 
 Greg Terror 
And responsibility 
because I was at the helm 
And just horrified
about making a decision
between like 
five people compared to one 
It was very scary 
to say the least 
 It was scary right 
 Yeah Oh yeah 
What was going through
your mind
as the train s coming
down the track 
It was mainly to warn them 
There are 
just to reiterate 
What s coming up 
What s coming up right now 
You don t want to have
to choose between people 
Right 
And that was really tough 
Either like six families
or one family 
It was like up to me 
it felt like Yeah 
It was interesting to me that
you had such presence of mind 
 Michael Yeah look for help
and make a decision 
The one that everyone 
if you ask them in a survey 
says that they would like
to be brave enough to make 
Yes so that was impressive 
Cory it really was 
You know I think it would
be good to have you meet
 some of the people who
participated so you can see 
 Awesome 
Yeah let s go do that 
just follow us on out
 and meet the actors 
 Michael Cory showed us
just how important
the debrief was
in this situation 
Meeting the actors 
which all of our subjects did 
reinforced that this
was not a reality 
So Greg trolley problem 
 Mm hmm 
 I went into this thinking
we re going to tease out
some general truths
about human nature 
However 
what we ve really seen
is that you learn
a lot about the individual 
 Everyone had some explanation
for their behavior 
 Each one was different 
Yes each one person told
themselves a story
about what was happening
according to the facts
and their analysis
of the surroundings
and what was going on
at the moment 
but it s also based
on their own background
and experience 
Totally there were people
who were just frozen 
realizing something was wrong
and they weren t prepared 
 Greg J R was
a great example of that 
He evaluated everything 
but at some point just said 
I don t know what to do 
Other people
were ready to say 
You know what 
This isn t on me 
It s on the technology 
I m sure it s being taken care
of by others 
Whereas someone like Cory 
 someone like Elsa said 
 switch clicks 
 No I have
to take control 
 click 
They still had some of
those same thoughts 
but I think what happened
is they realized
that if they did not
do something 
more people would be hurt 
Neither of them
really wanted
to do something 
They both felt compelled
to do something 
 cause they
had to save lives 
So was it worth doing
the trolley experiment 
I think it was
definitely worth it 
Some of these participants 
if not all of them 
learned something
about human behavior 
Although it was
a difficult experience 
Elsa learned what
inner strength she had 
and I think we had saw that
with Cory as well 
Every single one of
our participants felt like
 they just contributed
to something 
And they feel the value
of what just happened 
 It s not just us 
We ve since followed up
with our subjects 
and all of them are doing well 
I m glad we minimized risk
by prescreening
vulnerable individuals 
debriefing the participants 
and providing on site counseling
because doing so
gave me confidence
that we could explore this facet
of human psychology ethically 
We learned that there s
a stark difference
between what people
think they would do
and what they actually do
when faced
with a difficult moral dilemma 
Instead of saving five lives 
most of our participants
did nothing 
but is it wrong to freeze 
Should people feel bad
for being unable to act 
Well here s the thing 
Freezing in the face of a threat
is a behavior
that can be found
all over the animal kingdom 
but we are the only animals
that can study how we act 
pontificate
on how we ought to act 
and program machines
to do only that 
To make progress
in our study of the mind 
we have to affect the mind 
and that s not something
that we should take lightly 
Understanding who we are
by taking ourselves
to the limit comes with a risk 
and as we ve learned 
that risk
must always be balanced
against the greater good 
And as always 
This season 
on Mind Field 
You re going
to be a lab rat
Nobody s ever
done this before 
It s quite pioneering work 
really 
As far as I m concerned 
you re already a co author
on our scientific paper 
 Ready 
 Ready 
I m here on the Amazon 
where I will drink
an ancients psychedelic drug 
ayahuasca 
Don t worry 
this is a self driving car 
We ll connect through Bluetooth
to this living robot 
Okay and then
to the left 
 Whoa 
 Whoa ho ho 
I didn t realize
that you were a real person 
I m gonna tear you apart
if you don t give us
some answers 
I am going to be taking
a lie detection test 
 buzz 
 crackling 
You know Chinese water torture
isn t even Chinese 
Will five people die 
This is a big first for us 
We re actually getting
to do this for real 
Welcome to Mind Field 
Thanks for watching 
﻿Mind reading 
Of course not 
I love reading 
Look mind reading might sound
like pseudoscientific 
pardon my language 
bullshoot 
But its scientific counterpart 
thought identification 
is very much a real thing 
It s based in neuroimaging
and machine learning 
and what s really cool is
that experiments in mind reading
aren t just about spying
on what someone is thinking 
They re about figuring out
what thoughts are even made of 
I mean when I think
of something 
what does that mental picture
actually look like 
What resolution is it in 
How high fidelity
is a memory 
and how do they change
over time 
Well in this episode 
I m going to look at how
reading people s minds
can help us answer
these questions 
My journey begins right here
at the University of Oregon 
I m meeting with Dr Brice Kuhl
from the Kuhl lab 
He s a neuroscientist
who uses neuroimaging
and machine learning to figure
out what people are thinking
without them telling him 
So tell me what
you re doing here 
Well I m in the cognitive
neuroscience program here 
and I study human memory 
My lab primarily uses
neuroimaging methods 
so we do a lot of work using
functional magnetic
resonance imaging 
or fMRI 
And how do you use
fMRI to investigate memories 
We re looking at the pattern
of neural activity 
When you form a memory 
there s a certain pattern 
And we can record
that pattern
and then test whether
that pattern is reinstated
or reactivated at a later point 
like when you re remembering it 
Does that mean we can look at
the patterns of brain activity
and deduce what it is that is
being remembered or recalled 
or even just thought 
Yes and so we call that
decoding 
So it basically takes
your input pattern
as some pattern of activity
that we record
while you re remembering
something 
And we make a prediction
about what you re remembering 
You can see how this sounds
like mind reading 
Yes It sounds like that 
So Brice what are you going
to do to me today 
So what we re going
to be doing today
is uncharted territory
for us 
So we re going to be trying out
a kind of new variant
of the experiment on you 
So I can t guarantee
any particular results 
But it represents
where the field is
and where
we re trying to go 
Today you re going to
participate in an experiment
where you ll be studying faces 
So we re going
to have you study
 pictures of celebrities 
People I already am
familiar with 
 People that you know yeah 
And you re going to try
to remember those pictures 
Then we re going to have you go
into the MRI scanner 
Try to bring that picture
to mind as vividly as possible 
And we re going to be recording
your brain activity
as you try to imagine
these pictures 
We re going to try
to build the face 
Essentially draw a picture of
what you re remembering 
 A picture 
 A picture 
An actual picture
that we can print out
and I could like 
hang on my wall 
If you wanted 
 Michael The first step
is for me to memorize
the specific
celebrity photographs
Brice will later try
to detect me thinking about 
I sat down to do this
graduate student Max 
The success of his predictions
depend in part 
on my ability
to recall these faces
as vividly as possible
while inside the fMRI 
All right so 
 sighs 
I think I have a pretty good
memory of all of those 
 Great 
 I feel the stakes are high 
With the celebrity faces
hopefully memorized 
it s time for the next step 
going through
the metal detector
and into the fMRI 
where Brice will record
and monitor my brain activity 
and then later feed it into his
algorithm to rebuild the faces 
This will be the first time
he s attempted
to reconstruct faces
from long term memory 
which is very difficult 
because we re relying
on how clearly I can remember
the celebrity photos
I saw an hour ago 
I love its eyes 
Look at that 
 woman 
Wouldn t the kid be like 
It s going to eat me 
An fMRI monitors the activity
within the brain
by dividing it up
into thousands of small cubes
called voxels 
or volumetric pixels 
Each of these voxels contains
hundreds of thousands
of neurons 
Using fMRI 
we are able to detect
blood flow
within these voxels 
which means that that part
of the brain is active 
If I m shown several pictures
of people with mustaches 
my brain will react
to the features for each face 
But there will be
a common area of my brain
that is engaged
throughout 
That may be the area of my
brain that reacts to mustaches 
So later 
when I imagine a face 
if Brice notices
that area is engaged 
he can predict
that I am thinking
about a mustache 
So right now Michael s
in the scanner 
and he s seeing words appear
on the screen one at a time 
and he s trying
to visualize the face 
remember the face in as much
detail as possible 
What you can see here are
the images that we re acquiring 
We get one of these
brain volumes every two seconds 
So these are refreshing in real
time as we collect the images 
 Michael With part one
of the fMRI session over 
it s time for part two 
where Brice and his team
will learn the language
of my brain activity 
so they can later
decode by brain scans 
Hi Michael 
You doing okay still 
Yup 
They ll show me hundreds
of unique faces 
and record how my brain reacts
to certain facial
characteristics 
They will then use
this information
to reconstruct
the celebrity faces
I thought about during
the first phase of the scan 
Really the more faces that
we can show Michael the better 
So we re going to basically keep
him in there
as long as he s comfortable 
Two hours was the maximum time
we could get in the fMRI 
But I was able to look
at over faces 
which should be enough to get
some pretty interesting
results 
Hey Michael you did it 
That was great 
We re going to come
get you out 
All right 
Yeah so these just show
some of the pictures
that we were taking
while you were in there 
Some images of your brain 
Now we are going
to crunch some numbers 
Max is going to analyze
your data 
We ll meet up
again tomorrow 
where we ll look
at the results 
where we try to actually
reconstruct the face images
from the brain data
that we just collected 
Well see you tomorrow 
Thanks a lot 
Max thank you as well 
I can t wait 
You better pull
an all nighter 
I want this data
to be perfect 
All right so I am back
at Dr Kuhl s lab 
Overnight his team
crunched the data 
and I can t wait to see what
they think they saw me thinking 
How are my results 
I think they look good 
We re going to take a look
in just a moment here 
All right 
 So can I just take a seat 
 Yeah have a seat 
first of all 
what am I seeing 
Oh okay well 
these are the pictures
I actually memorized 
 That s right 
 And this is what
you ve reconstructed
from my imagination 
 Oh wow Okay 
 Brice 
Okay so this is one
of the reconstructions
that was generated 
Interesting 
 Max 
So that s John Cho 
Not bad Not bad 
 Can we see the side by side 
I see you know similarities
in the kind of facial
expressions in general 
You know you could almost
see the hairline matching here 
The shape of the face
I also thought was 
It kind of had
a square shape to it 
 Yes Yes 
 So those are the things
that came out to me 
And so when I was
visualizing
this image of John Cho 
the squareness of the face was
the first most salient thing 
I just kept thinking 
he was the square guy 
Excellent all right 
So that s Megan Fox 
Mm hmm 
You re going to show us the 
side by side 
The side by side Right 
You can see the picture
you actually saw 
and that s the reconstruction
we generated 
I ll you this 
Megan Fox I was not able
to have a really clear picture
in my mind 
For some reason this image
of her was really hard for me
to bring back into my mind 
The sternness in the face was
something that I did pick up on 
So I did sense that there was 
It looked feminine 
And you picked up
on the sternness 
And so together 
that produces a match 
 Michael Keep in mind
that Brice and his team
have read these
from my memory 
But when I remember a face 
do I picture every detail
simultaneously
with photographic accuracy 
Or do I just attend to a few
at a time 
By reading my mind 
they may be seeing
how bad my memory is 
and how it works 
 Me Me 
 Brice laughs 
Okay so that is your
reconstruction
of me thinking about
this image of myself 
That s right 
Where d the beard go 
 Brice I don t know 
I was hoping you could tell me 
For instance this is a picture
of me remembering my own face 
It really doesn t look like me 
but the question is 
how good am I
at picturing myself 
I don t think of my own face
that often 
so the strangeness
in the result
may be as much about flaws
in my own memory
and mental picture of myself
as flaws in the technology 
So that s Jennifer Lawrence 
I believe 
That s Jennifer Lawrence 
It looks like it s Jennifer
Lawrence s much older uncle 
 all chuckle 
Nothing here was too
mind blowingly close 
But this is something that
you re just starting out trying
these sort of long term
memories 
What Brice and his team
read in my mind
might have been more accurate
if they d shown me thousands
rather than hundreds of images
in the fMRI 
because then the algorithm
would have learned
the language of my brain
more thoroughly 
But regardless 
the quality of my memories
would have still
been an issue 
I mean look what happens
when memory
is cut out of the equation
entirely 
Brice also read
my brain activity
when I was looking
at faces in the fMRI 
not just imagining them 
And those results
were much closer
than those reconstructed
Okay so what am I looking at
right here 
Okay so what you re seeing here
in the top row 
these are images that you saw
while you were in the scanner 
Below that in this bottom row 
these are the reconstructions
that we draw from the patterns
of brain activity we collected 
 This is from the source image 
These are from my brain 
 Brice Right 
 Michael They re pretty close 
Yeah overall they were
pretty close 
So not perfect 
These are you can see there s
some variability in these 
But this is consistent
with what we ve found before 
that the reconstructions
that we generated 
when you re viewing
the faces 
there is some correspondence
between the actual face 
So this is kind of
a sanity check 
that we can actually
reconstruct the images
 when you re viewing them 
 Right right 
They re pretty good 
Well Brice Max 
thank you so much
for letting me
be a part of this 
I hope my data s useful 
It s been a lot of fun 
It s always useful for us
to think about these things 
Dr Brice Kuhl s memory research
is showing that it s possible
for a computer
to read someone s mind 
To figure out
what they re thinking 
But a lot of progress
still needs to be made 
I mean if you want to know
what I m thinking right now 
for example 
it s still easier to just ask me
to tell you 
But what if I can t
tell you 
Dr Yukiyasu Kamitani
is a researcher 
professor and pioneer
exploring the frontier
behind the wall of sleep 
I ve come here
to Kyoto University
to meet with him and to see
what it s like
to read not what someone
is thinking 
but what someone
is dreaming 
Kamitani sensei 
I m Michael 
 Hi I m Yuki 
 Yuki nice to meet you 
For the last ten years 
Dr Kamitani has been
at the forefront
of machine mind reading 
The subject is you know 
ready to go in 
Similar to Brice Kuhl 
his early experiments explored
reconstructing images
shown to subjects in an fMRI
based on their brain activity 
In Kamitani s case 
the images were
black and white shapes 
and the reconstructions
were strikingly accurate 
Recently Kamitani has focused
on using deep neural networks
and machine learning
to decipher subjects 
brain activity
while they view
much more complex photographs 
What you re seeing is the
result of a deep neural network
processing the brain activity
of a subject
looking at the photograph 
This could have myriad
applications in the future 
in criminal investigations
and interpersonal
communication 
 Kamitani 
This is far from perfect 
But I think you still see some 
you know eyes and you know 
Well yeah 
And colors too 
Yeah to some extent yeah 
His most current work however 
is about the subconscious 
He s attempting something
extremely ambitious 
recording our dreams 
Would you call yourself
a sleep researcher 
or a vision researcher 
Maybe a brain decoder 
A brain decoder 
That s a pretty cool
job description 
Can you show me anything from
what you re doing with dreams 
Mm hmm yeah 
Dr Kamitani s work
on dream decoding
begins with a similar process
to Dr Kuhl s 
showing the test subject
thousands of images
while they are in an fMRI
in order to learn
what the brain looks like
when it is thinking
of certain things 
Once the machine learning
algorithm is pretty good
at identifying what images
the subject is thinking about 
the subject is placed
in an fMRI
with an EEG cap
on their head 
and invited to fall asleep 
When the EEG waves indicate
that the person is dreaming 
the algorithm predicts
which kinds of things
the subject is most likely
dreaming about 
Right now the algorithm
looks for categories 
Things like buildings 
transportation 
and characters
in a language 
Researchers then awaken
the subject 
ask them what they were
dreaming about 
and see if the algorithm s
prediction
and the person s
recollection match 
Here is actual data from
one of Kamitani s experiments 
Below is a word cloud
of categories 
The name of each category
get bigger or smaller
in real time
based on the probability
that they are present
in the subject s current dream 
Now as you can see 
activity is currently strongest
for the category character 
meaning written language 
At this point
the subject was awoken 
and this is what
they reported 
That s pretty spooky 
 laughs 
 Right I mean you 
you spied on their dream 
Yeah in a way 
But 
the accuracy s
not that great so 
Well the accuracy s
not that great but you know 
my normal accuracy for guessing
people s dreams is zero 
While continuing
his research
into predicting
the content of dreams 
Dr Kamitani is embarking
on his newest project 
actually reconstructing images
from our dreams 
So you ve brought
some of the reconstructions
that your lab has created 
 of dreams 
Right they all look like dreams
about blobs 
I mean I want to just
take a step back and 
appreciate that what we re
looking at on this screen
are in a way some of the first
photographs of a dream 
We are looking
at the earliest phase
of revolutionary research 
One day we may able
to have images 
or even record movies 
of our own dreams 
And Dr Kamitani is the only
person in the world
doing this so far 
He s a lone explorer journeying
into our subconscious 
So this work hasn t even
been published yet 
 Thank you for showing it to me 
The insights that researchers
like Dr Kuhl and Dr Kamitani
might be capable of achieving
in the future
because of mind reading
are difficult
to fully fathom 
But let s slow down
for a second 
because we re talking
about a technology
that can know us
better than we know ourselves 
Should we really
be doing this 
Well to address
that question 
I m going to meet
with an expert in ethics 
neuroscience
and artificial intelligence 
Julia Bossmann 
She s the director of strategy
at Fathom Computing 
a council member
of the World Economic Forum 
an alum of Ray Kurzweil s
Singularity University 
and a former president
of the Foresight Institute 
a think tank specializing
in future technologies
and their impacts 
Julia thanks for taking some
time to chat 
 Yeah of course 
 You are the perfect person
for me to bring
these questions to 
 And they re deep questions 
But I think they re
extremely important 
and they re becoming
more and more pressing 
I think we re living in such
an interesting time right now 
because we re in this time
where brains and machines
are actually moving
closer together 
So when it comes
to being able
to look at brain activity 
where are
the ethical lines here 
How private should
my internal thoughts be 
Like with any powerful
technology 
it depends on the hands
that wield it 
All these new technologies
are things that can make whoever
uses them more powerful 
So we want to not blame
the technology but we want to 
how is it being used 
and who is using it 
So how do we make sure
that this technology
is in the right hands 
So I think it s very important
to involve people
who act on policy and law
to understand what is coming
in the future 
I am hopeful about
the collaborative aspect of it 
Let s talk about
the good things now 
I mean what are
the applications here 
Yeah so if we think about
the late Stephen Hawking 
if he had a way of richer
interfacing with the world
or with computers 
we can only imagine
what he could have
shared with us 
Those with locked in syndrome 
right 
They are there 
They know that they are there 
But we just need something
to look into their brain
to see what it is
that they are trying to say 
 or what they re feeling 
 Right exactly 
So what do you say
to people
that have that kind of fear
of technology 
of us surrendering our true
natural selves to technology 
There is something enticing
about getting to the next level
of what some people might call
a human evolution
or civilization development 
and so on 
In a way we are already not
living natural lives right 
Because then most of us would
die before the age of 
I don t know or 
We would have all kinds
of diseases 
We would not wear
this clothing 
We wouldn t have eyeglasses
or contact lenses 
We wouldn t have antibiotics 
 Julia 
We are already kind of
very futuristic cyborgs
if we compare ourselves
to the human that was living
 years ago
and was genetically
almost identical
with who we are now 
Yeah we really are 
In order to understand
cognition 
right now we basically have
to either just ask people
to talk about
what they re thinking 
or observe their behavior 
But reading thoughts directly
would be a lot better 
That is how Dr Kuhl
is studying memory 
and it s how Dr Kamitani
is studying sleep and dreams 
But even though the technology
has a long way to go 
it s easy to see
how ethical questions
could become an issue 
Well here s the thing 
there is no such thing
as a totally wild human 
We are co evolving
Humans and technology today
are inseparable 
Now it s true that we need
to be careful
about every new thing we do 
but we cannot change the fact
that they will happen 
It s a story we ve lived through
again and again 
You know we could have
sat around forever
debating whether or not
a speed limit should exist
and who should have
the authority to enforce it 
But we didn t 
Instead we went ahead
and invented cars 
and responsibly figured out
the details as we went along 
Ethical questions
about new technologies
do the most good when
they facilitate the technology 
not when they needlessly
hinder progress 
So follow your dreams 
And as soon as you can 
show them to me 
﻿ When it comes to illusions 
optical illusions
get all the attention 
But the whole body you have
can be fooled
and can fool the brain 
One of my favorite
physical illusions
is the thermal grill illusion 
and you can do it
right at home 
I have some hot dog halves
in an ice bath 
I also have warm
hot dog halves 
Now what I m going to do
is marry the halves together
so that they alternate 
warm cool 
Warm cool 
When I m done 
I will have a torture device 
But not one that hurts
your body 
one that hurts your mind 
Rosanna Pansino 
 Hello Michael 
 Welcome to Mind Field 
 chuckles 
 Rosanna Pansino is the host
of the YouTube cooking show
Nerdy Nummies 
 Brain cake 
Mmm 
 So I thought she would be
the perfect candidate
to try out
our hot dog illusion 
 Oh yeah 
 Now you didn t hear or see
anything I just did right 
 Good all right 
Well you are in
for a treat 
What I want you to do is take
the bottom of your forearm
and place it skin showing 
Right onto these hot dogs 
 Oh 
 What d you feel 
 Ouch 
But now touch them
individually 
 Oh like hurt 
Cold warm cold warm 
cold warm 
 But none of them is as hot
as they all felt together 
So what s going on 
 I don t know Magic 
What s going on over here 
 Can I try 
Of course I can try 
It s my show 
 Yeah do it 
What we ve built here
is a version
of the thermal grill illusion 
And for reasons
that are still being debated 
this can cause a sensation
of pain 
Maybe the sensors we have 
specific to hot and cold 
are both also specific
to extreme pain 
And getting them to fire
right together
makes the body think 
Whoa whoa whoa 
If they re both firing
that near to each other 
that means get away 
 Red alert 
 Red alert yeah 
 That s what my arm did 
 So what I m really trying
to say is
this is a great way
to hurt someone
without there ever being a mark
or any actual damage 
 That s pretty sneaky 
 Do try this at home 
 tranquil music 
 The surface
of the human body
contains millions
of nerve endings
that send touch related sensory
information to the brain 
But in some cases 
those sensations
don t even need to be generated
by nerve endings 
Ever heard of sympathy pain 
The most well known type
of sympathy pain
is called couvade syndrome 
It s when
a pregnant woman s husband
goes through labor pains 
Husbands can actually
sympathize
with their pregnant wives
so much
that they experience
the same problems 
such as weight gain 
insomnia 
nausea mood swings 
et cetera 
Sympathy pain is also known
as synesthetic pain 
It s pain sparked by seeing
someone else get hurt 
 Ooh 
 Amputees can actually
be more susceptible to it
because experiencing trauma can
make the brain more sensitive
to other people s pain 
Amputees can also feel pain
in the limb
that is no longer there 
That is known
as phantom pain 
But perhaps
the most surprising way
that the brain and pain
interact
can be demonstrated
by the nocebo effect 
Have you ever heard
of the placebo effect 
It s like when
a fake pain pill
actually cures
a person s pain
because they have a positive
expectation it will work 
Well today 
we re demonstrating
the exact opposite 
If a subject expects
they re going to experience
something unpleasant 
like pain 
will they feel it
even if it actually exists
only in their mind 
We ve told our subject that
she s participating in a study
to test a non invasive
bone density scanner 
But actually 
it s a totally fake machine
that we built from a desk lamp 
an air compressor 
and the kind
of laser pointer
you might tease your cat with 
It doesn t cause physical pain 
or for that matter 
physical sensation
of any kind 
It doesn t hurt at all 
You guys this doesn t work 
 laughter 
But will the expectation
alone
make our subject think
she s feeling real pain 
 So come on in here 
and take a seat right there 
And then when you feel
ready to drive 
just let us know
and we ll dismiss you okay 
 Okay Thank you 
 First we have to make
our subject
expect to experience pain 
And to do that our actors are
going to scare her a little 
Sorry Jessica 
this is for science 
 So are you already done 
 Yeah I just you know 
need a minute 
Then I ll be good to go 
 What d you do 
 It s like a targeted laser 
It tests bone density 
 Did it hurt 
 By the look on her face 
it appears we have successfully
primed our subject
for what s to come 
 Okay Jessica 
we re ready for you 
 The question is 
when put to the test 
will she actually feel pain
when there is really
none there 
 This is Jessica 
 Hi Jessica 
Come on in 
Won t you have a seat 
 Everything in this room 
the medical equipment 
the hospital supplies 
even the demeanor
of our fake nurse 
is designed to play
on Jessica s mind 
To psychologically induce
the anticipation of pain 
We re testing out some
equipment 
It s not invasive 
We need to measure
the side effects
and patient reaction 
And I want you to be
really descriptive
about what you re feeling 
And pay close attention
to the pain that you feel
and how it grows 
Notice how we are suggesting
that she will feel pain 
further raising
her expectations 
 I m gonna give you
a ball to squeeze
for pain management okay 
 And any time you want to stop 
it stops right away 
 Okay 
 machine humming 
 It s definitely warm 
 Uh huh 
And like like tingly 
 After only about seven
seconds 
she s already feeling a
physical sensation on her skin 
where there is none 
Keep in mind we tested
our fake bone scanner 
and the light emits zero heat
or feeling of any kind 
 Yeah now it s 
doesn t feel that great 
 You want me to turn it off 
 No it s okay 
 We re at seconds 
 Really like stinging 
 A sting 
 A sting and like 
really really hot 
 Now it s hot 
We re at seconds 
 Yeah it doesn t it s 
 Okay I m gonna turn it off 
 Okay thanks 
 You described warm
turning to hot 
 It was like warm
and then that like heat grew
into more of like 
a sting 
 On this pain scale 
could you point to
the amount of pain
you were feeling 
 Between a six and a seven 
 According to the pain
assessment scale 
she experienced
significant pain 
This is completely up to you 
but we can move to level two 
which is slightly
more intense 
 How many more levels
are there 
 Uh there s just five 
 There s five levels 
 There are five 
 Oh my gosh 
 But again 
you re in the driver s seat 
 Uh yeah sure Let s do it 
 Here s another test
of our nocebo 
Will she feel an increase
in her level of pain
if she expects to 
 Keep in mind 
level two is fake 
We re not doing anything
different than before 
meaning nothing
is happening to her 
 So yeah it started off
higher
than the last time 
I think 
It s definitely like 
already stinging 
 Immediately she reports
increased pain on level two 
It s seconds 
 It feels really really 
really hot and 
like penetrating 
 How deep 
 seconds 
 I don t know like 
 and inch or like 
an inch 
Yeah it is 
it s very hot 
Um like burning 
Like my whole arm is like 
on fire 
 We can stop at any time 
 You want to call it 
 Okay we re off 
 Do you need a tissue 
 Yeah thank you 
 You re welcome 
 sniffs 
 Could you rank for me
how you felt at level two 
 Like 
 The power of suggestion
was so strong 
our nocebo caused our subject
to think
she felt almost the worst pain
imaginable 
Other subject felt different
imaginary sensations 
 The muscles are kind of uh 
kind of burning
a little bit 
 Stop 
 How did that feel 
 That was like a seven 
Actually it s tingling
a lot more now
than it was before 
 I was surprised
at the intense reaction
some subjects had to a feeling
that was created
only in their minds 
 Look I m gonna stop it now 
That was seconds 
Describe for me the sensations
that you were having 
 It felt like
a little prickle
like when you get
goose bumps 
 What about our original
subject
who experienced a severe
 on the pain scale 
How will she feel when she
learns it was all in her head 
I want to debrief you
on everything
that we re up to today 
So this is
a psychology program 
and this equipment is not
doing anything to you 
This is just a machine
that makes noise 
And that s just a laser pointer
on a lamp 
 For real 
 For real 
 Oh my God laughing 
 You were never in danger 
 We didn t do anything to you 
 Oh my God 
 This is an investigation
in pain anticipation 
 Yeah that worked 
 I was so scared laughing 
I was so close to like 
going to like 
just say You know what 
I changed my mind 
I was so close to leaving 
 You did say that you felt
a prickle 
 How do you feel about that 
 Whether it was really
I did get goose bumps
or I was nervous 
which is why I felt it 
I know as a person like 
if I think there s going
to be pain 
I m gonna feel something 
 I do still feel like 
kind of like
a burning sensation
on my arms 
is so strong
that this subject continued to
imagine a physical sensation 
even after learning
it wasn t real 
The name for the effect
is the nocebo effect 
It s a negative effect caused
by nothing but the mind 
 It makes perfect sense 
the power of suggestion 
I m shaky just thinking
about it 
 Pain and touch are weird 
But what about when touch
straddles the line
between pleasure and pain 
When a sensation
makes you laugh
and drives you crazy 
I m talking about tickling 
Part of what makes you laugh
when you re tickled
is the element of surprise 
Your brain doesn t know
exactly what to expect
or when it s going to happen 
On the other hand 
it s impossible
to tickle yourself 
If the brain knows
where and when and how
you are going to be touched 
you won t laugh 
But professors of cognitive
at the University College
London
have invented
the tickle machine 
Subjects sit in
the tickle machine
with their feet against
a brush
that is connected
to a handle 
At first when the subjects
turn the handle 
the brush rotates
at the exact same time
resulting in no tickling 
Then the machine is switched
into tickle mode 
 Which causes a delay
of less than a second
between when the subject
turns the handle
and when the brush moves
against their foot 
 This slight change
is enough to prevent
the brain s cerebellum
from predicting
the sensation 
thus allowing the subject
to respond to the tickle 
 Tickles can be fun 
Pain not so much 
If you couldn t feel pain 
that would be great right 
Or would it 
Let s meet Steve Pete 
Steve I understand
you don t feel pain 
 Yes I was born
with a rare genetic condition
called congenital insensitivity
to pain 
It only affects about to 
of us around the world with it 
 Only or people 
So far that we ve been able
to find 
 And tell me what it means when
you say you don t feel pain 
 Pain is used
to detect injury
and it kind of sends a signal
to your brain saying 
Hey don t do this anymore 
It s an alarm system 
So what happens
with my condition is
we feel what s going on
like if I were to touch
your shoulder 
you would feel me
touching your shoulder 
but if I were to touch
your shoulder in a way
that s painful 
I would feel just a pressure 
and the signal of pain
would not travel to my brain 
 Okay so you feel everything 
 Everything else 
that I feel 
but you just don t feel pain 
 Yeah Correct 
 But that could be dangerous 
How did you first find out
that you had this condition 
 Well what happened was
I was teething
and I chewed
part of my tongue off 
So my parents quickly took me
to my pediatrician 
 Wow Are you ticklish 
 Do you itch 
 Do you like massages 
 Do you take painkillers 
 What about a headache 
 What about spicy peppers 
 I enjoy them yeah 
I mean I do sense
the burning sensation 
but nothing painful 
 What about intestine pain
like gas pain 
 That s something
I don t feel 
so that kind of ties into
one of my biggest fears 
which is having like 
appendicitis
or any other type
of internal damage
that I just don t know about
until it s too late 
 Is there an upside to this 
I m sure that people 
often naively 
hear that you don t feel pain 
 And they think 
Well you should become
a boxer 
 The only upside to it is 
uh 
being that I have had so many
injuries during my childhood 
as I get older I won t feel
the pain that comes with it 
Other than that really 
I just try to live
my life normally
as everyone else does 
 I cannot describe
pain to you 
Just like you can t describe
a color to someone who s blind 
 Which is where I run into
my problem
with trying to describe
what not feeling pain is like 
 Wow I ll bet 
Well Steve 
thank you very much 
This was really 
really fascinating 
So not being able to feel pain
is actually a bad thing 
But likewise the anticipation
of pain can be bad too 
Just making someone think
that they might be tortured soon
could be a torture device 
The CIA and Guantanamo Bay
are known
for using
psychological torture
involving the anticipation
of pain
against prisoners
in the war on terror 
The effects of this type
of torture can last a lifetime 
So what s worse 
Waiting for pain to happen
or the pain itself 
You might be surprised 
We re basing our investigation
on an anticipation of pain
experiment 
conducted at the
University College London 
which gave subject
two options 
Option one Experience
intense pain right away 
Or option two Anticipate
a lower level of pain
in intervals
every few minutes 
Researchers found that the
psychological effects of dread
can often be worse
than the pain itself 
We decided to demonstrate
the phenomenon
by setting up
a fake research study 
We are looking into
the effects of electrical
stimulation on the body 
 It s all completely harmless 
But it can be unpleasant 
 So we ll show you
the two settings all right 
I want to show you first what we
call the light setting okay 
 I guess so 
 buzzing 
Oh 
 And then there s
the high setting 
 Ow 
 I don t laughing 
 All right so again 
unpleasant definitely 
 But you re safe 
We call this the low voltage
or light shock 
Hmm okay 
 And now we ll show you the
high voltage or higher shock 
 Oh okay 
Ooh 
 Now it s time
for our subjects
to make an important choice 
All right so now that you know
the two differences 
you either can choose
choice A 
which is one high voltage shock
every ten seconds for a minute 
 Will our subjects choose
the higher 
more painful shocks 
but get it over with
right away 
Or choice B
is one low voltage shock
every ten minutes
for one hour 
Or will they choose
the lower shocks 
but be forced to anticipate
the pain for ten minutes
between shocks
for a solid hour 
Either way 
you will be here for an hour 
What s worse 
A higher level of pain 
Or having to wait
and anticipate
the lower level of pain 
 I ll take the long 
 I think I ll do the shorter 
uh more painful one 
Now that they ve made
their choices 
it s time to see how
our subjects
experience these two options 
The subject who chose
to anticipate
the lower level of pain
during the course of an hour
is seated in the low shock
administration room 
along with our actors 
who are pretending
to get shocked 
 This subject s hour long
ordeal is just beginning 
But what about the subject
who chose to get it over with
and take the more painful
shocks right away 
 We re starting now 
Here s shock number one 
 Ow 
 Yes the shock is painful 
but it was her choice 
 This is shock number two 
 It s really painful 
 Shock number three 
 It s half over 
It may hurt more but she s
getting it over with quickly 
 Shock number four 
Number five 
Number six 
 Okay you re done 
Meanwhile our other subject
is only on shock number one 
That s one shock down 
five more to go 
While the pain level
may be lower 
the subject has plenty of time
for the pain
and its anticipation
to occupy his mind 
 Hi Jerome 
would you come with me 
 Finally his hour is up 
Tell me about why you chose
the lower voltage choice 
 I guess you re 
less pain you know 
 While you were sitting there
waiting for ten minutes
to elapse 
how did you feel 
It s so quiet in there 
so basically you got
your thoughts 
Your thoughts is like 
Okay it s coming 
 This anxiety may be the
reason why
in the original study 
a full of subjects
opted to receive the more
painful shocks right away 
rather than suffer through
the mental torture
of anticipation 
Why did you choose
the higher shock group 
 Just knowing that it was over
within a minute 
I think ten seconds
is easier to go along with
what was coming next 
So it s kind of like
ripping a band aid off 
I guess 
 You d rather 
 Hard and fast 
 Hard and fast 
 Yeah yeah 
 soft music 
Tickling may be annoying 
and pain may be well 
painful 
but we crave touch 
Hugging feels amazing 
Hugging can actually decrease
your risk
of catching the common cold 
And hugging
can lower blood pressure 
Hugging can also release
oxytocin 
the so called
bonding hormone 
I guess what I m trying
to say is 
stay in touch 
﻿ ambient music playing 
 Michael Derek have you
ever watched Mind Field
on YouTube 
No but I would like
to watch it Michael 
So Mind Field
has a theme song
that I d love
for you to listen to
to see if you can play it
for me on the piano 
I would like to listen to it 
Michael 
Just load this up here 
 playing piano 
Oh hello 
This is a tray of brains 
Cow brains 
Here is a sagittal slice
I prepared earlier 
Now imagine that
this is my brain 
Just looking at it 
it would be impossible to know
what part does what
or that different parts
did different things at all 
But if you change
specific parts of your brain 
you can often affect
specific functions 
So if this was my brain 
that would be pretty bad 
I would almost certainly
have just become
cortically bind 
Of course scientists can t go
cutting and poking
and stabbing people s brains
to see how it affects
their behavior 
but they can study the behavior
and abilities of people
whose brains are different
from neurotypical brains 
For instance in rare cases 
people whose eyes
function normally
but who are blind due to damage
to their visual cortex
may experience
the neurological phenomenon
of blindsight
which allows them
to sense and respond
to objects they cannot see 
Due to a brain injury 
this patient
is consciously blind
on his right side 
But while he sees nothing
in his right field of vision 
he s able to sense
the presence and motion
of an object he cannot see 
 man You re moving it
up and down 
I am aware of a motion 
but that motion has no shape 
no color no depth 
no form no contrast 
 Michael Blindsight is possible
because besides
the visual cortex
which is associated
with conscious vision 
there are other brain areas
that get information
from the eyes unconsciously 
We have learned about this
unconscious vision we all have
because of blindsight 
The study of divergent minds
has revolutionized
our understanding of the brain
in ways that would not have been
possible otherwise 
People who differ from the norm
expose elements
of all our minds
that we didn t even know
were there 
 ambient music playing 
 upbeat music playing 
 Michael One very special
divergent mind
is that of Derek Paravicini 
Let s go 
We re gonna count a hundred
 to find the hotel okay 
 Okay Yeah 
 both One 
two 
three 
 Michael Derek is both
blind and autistic 
He s also a musical savant 
Now for the live music
you were promised 
 Michael meaning despite
severe cognitive
and social impairments 
his musical ability
is far greater
than what would be
considered normal 
And tonight he s performing
at the release party
for his latest album 
 playing Flight
of the Bumblebees 
Derek possesses
an incredible gift 
He s performed
all over the world
and has become
a symbol of success
for other autistic individuals 
Later we ll take a deeper look
into Derek s unique mind 
 Michael One hundred
and fifty years ago 
scientists still didn t know
if different parts of the brain
did different things 
It was only by studying people
with atypical minds
that we discovered that
there are different modules
in the brain that have
different functions 
The first major discovery
showing that the brain had
these specialized modules
was made by a doctor
named Paul Broca in the s 
Broca had heard of a patient
who had no problem
understanding language 
but who struggled
to produce language 
The only thing the patient
could say
was the sound tan 
over and over 
He would say tan 
tan tan tan tan tan tan 
tan tan tan tan tan 
When the patient died 
Broca performed
an autopsy on him
and found that
the patient s brain
had damage to a specific part
of its left hemisphere 
Broca concluded
that this brain region 
now called Broca s Area 
must be important
for producing speech
but not
for understanding speech 
This language deficit
called Broca s Aphasia
still affects hundreds
of thousands of people
who get strokes
in the left side of their brain 
A patient with Broca s Aphasia
can talk 
but struggles
to get the words out 
 woman So what s your name 
Scott 
 Sarah Scott 
 woman That s right 
And how old are you 
I can t 
 woman Try 
 I can t 
 Michael Another part
of the brain related to speech
is Wernicke s Area
with language comprehension 
Patients who damage
this region
can speak fluenty
but they are unabe
to understand languae
or use it in a meaningful wa 
 woman What were we just doing
with the iPad 
Right at the moment
a darn should a darn thing 
 woman With the iPad
that we were doing 
Like here 
I d like my change for me
and change hands for me 
It was happy 
I would talk with Donna
sometimes 
We re all with them 
Other people are working
with them them 
I m very happy with them 
These remarkable individuals
have taught us a lot
about the neural basis
of language 
But it can be tricky
to infer the functions
of different brain areas
based only
on specific patients 
That s because damage is almost
never confined to one spot
and the brain
can reorganize itself
after it s been damaged 
So to get a more precise picture
of how changing the brain
affects behavior and function 
I went to UCLA
to have my brain damaged 
But not permanently 
I m not gonna have
a piece of my brain
removed and thrown away 
Instead I m going to have
part of my brain tissue
temporarily
and safely disrupted
by a technology called
transcranial
magnetic stimulation 
Here I go 
Usually I start
by saying I m glad to be here 
I m medium to be here 
I m a little anxious about
what s about to happen 
Today you re going
to be giving me
a brain lesion 
temporarily 
So I should cease to be able
to produce words 
That actually just sounds
very frightening 
I like to be in control 
especially of myself 
Should I be worried 
 Michael Transcranial
magnetic stimulation 
or TMS for short 
applies a strong magnetic pulse
to one part of the brain
such as Broca s Area 
This briefly disrupts
electric function
in the part of the brain
that is stimulated 
It s like causing
temporary brain damage 
But as soon as
the pulse is over 
functioning
goes back to normal 
While it s not guaranteed
that TMS
will affect
my ability to speak 
Dr Iacoboni
has successfully stimulated
Broca s Aphasia
on other test subjects 
Transcranial
to see what happens when such 
 clicking 
 indistinct speech 
 tradition
of studying individuals 
 Michael Now it was time
to have my speech disrupted 
But to stimulate
my Broca s Area 
first we had to find it
using an MRI scan of my brain 
Hopefully we ll be able to find
Broca s Area
and shut me up 
 John So it s gonna feel
a little bit like
somebody tapping
on your scalp 
and you might feel
some superficial
muscle stimulation 
 Uh hmm 
 John So this will
probably be
a little bit uncomfortable 
It might be
a lot uncomfortable 
If it becomes too much 
just say the word stop 
and we will stop 
I m just gonna pull out
the first chapter
of Pride and Prejudice
by Jane Austen
and I ll just
start reading 
and you guys will start
stimulating my Broca s Area 
 My dear Mr Bennet 
said his lady to him one day 
 Have you heard that
Netherfield Park
 is let at last 
Mr Bennet replied
that he had not 
 But it is 
returned she 
 for Mrs Long
has just been here
 and she told me
all about it 
Mr Bennet made no answer 
 Do you not want to know
who has taken it 
cried his wife impatiently 
 You want to tell me and I have
no objection to hearing it 
This was invitation enough 
We tried a couple of times 
but my Broca s Area seemed
to be playing hard to get 
So we repositioned
the machine 
New trajectory 
Enter 
Okay great 
 You and the girls may go 
 or you may send them
by themselves 
 which perhaps
will be better still 
 for as you are as handsome
as any of them 
 Mr Bingley may like you
the best of the party 
 When a woman
has five grown up 
After several more attempts 
we were still unsuccessful
at finding my Broca s Area
and disrupting my speech 
 married its solace
was visiting and news 
I beat it 
Yeah no You cannot stop
her from being heard 
While neuromapping
allows us to locate
the many different areas
of the brain 
the brain is one of the most
complex organs in our body
and not all brains respond
to TMS in the same way 
TMS didn t work on me
this time 
but different test subjects
produce different results 
Is find out what 
 indistinct 
Okay that s probably good
for now 
 Michael TMS is currently
being evaluated
to treat depression
and certain types
of brain damage 
One day it may even be used
to reduce the effects
of traumatic brain injury 
 Michael I traveled to London
to meet someone
who was using
his divergent mind
in an extraordinary way 
Derek it s Michael 
 Oh hello Michael 
 Nice to meet you 
I m Derek How are you 
Would you like
to come in Michael 
I m fantastic 
I would love to come in 
Yes It s an honor 
I wanted to find out what Derek
could teach us about all brains 
So Derek I m doing a show
called Mind Field
about psychology 
Do you know psychology 
I do know psychology 
Your brain
is different than mine 
Would you agree 
I would agree Michael 
 It s different
than my brain yes 
It became evident
very quickly
that this was going to be
an atypical interview 
I m sure you hear
all the time
about how spectacular
your abilities are 
Were you told that
even at a young age
when you first started
to interact with a piano 
I was told at a young age
when I first started
to interact with a piano 
 Michael Derek has echolalia 
a condition which causes him
to repeat back words
spoken to him 
It s his way
of trying to understand
the spoken word 
You can learn music
just by listening to it 
I can learn music
by listening to it Michael 
But while Derek may find
spoken language challenging 
he has no problem communicating
through music 
 playing jazz 
There are about seven million
autistic savants worldwide
with some level
of savant skills 
but Derek is what s known
as a prodigious savant 
which means that his musical
skills are so outstanding
that they would be
considered spectacular
even for highly trained
neurotypical musicians 
There are probably fewer than
a hundred prodigious savants
in the whole world 
 Alan Derek Paravicini
has a musicality
that I think any performer
would envy 
What sort of music
do you really love Derek 
Uh maybe
pop music or 
 Jazz Derek 
A bit of jazz yeah 
Since he was five years old 
Derek has been mentored
by Adam Ockelford 
Through the door 
Well done Derek 
Adam is a music psychologist 
author and professor
at the University
of Roehampton 
That s your right hand 
now do your left hand 
Go on 
Derek was born very premature 
Twenty six weeks 
which thirty eight
years ago was very 
very premature 
And they didn t
have any equipment
in the hospital for him 
So they rushed him
into the nearest hospital
that had an incubator 
and Derek
wasn t thought able
to survive and yet he did 
He s such a fighter 
Because of the circumstances
of his birth
and the impact of blindness
and learning difficulties 
his brain developed
in a particular kind of way 
As a little boy he was
very fascinated by sound 
not being able to see 
And his nanny gave him
this little electric organ
and that was like
a eureka moment for him
and the beginnings
of his music
processing ability 
So things like language 
things like
perhaps understanding
how people feel 
these things are very
difficult for Derek 
And yet his music
is way above average 
Derek s got
an amazingly quick ear 
haven t you Derek 
 I have yes 
 If I go like 
or 
He can process
an amazing 
 Michael It s like automatic 
That s impressive Derek 
Thank you Michael 
Yeah no the response
to pitch that you make Derek 
is incredibly fast 
We ve measured the time
between playing
even a big chord 
say like this one 
And Derek can listen and react
to an eight note chord
within about of a second 
 Wow 
 Derek s sense of pitch
is very unusual 
 It s also known as perfect 
 It is It is perfect 
Something like of babies
born premature
who lose their sight
have perfect pitch
as opposed to
about one in ten thousand
in the neurotypical population 
So you can see that
the impact of not being
able to see
has a massive effect on
the way the brain develops 
And how does autism
play into this 
Well autism
is an added factor 
Autism starts at very early
in life we know that 
And in Derek s case 
of course 
when he came out
of the incubator 
And what autism tends
to do is to give children
this immense focus
on the sheer quality of things 
whether it s a sound or a 
or a color or a scent 
That s the quality
that we all have as babies 
that we experience the world
in this sheer perception 
Now most babies very quickly
come out of that
by months 
They re starting
to categorize things
just to make sense of the amount
of information that s coming in 
So you re born 
and your body is like 
consuming all
of this sense data raw 
 Michael And then
it learns that s crazy 
We don t need to process
every little detail 
We only need to understand
what s important
or relevant 
and that s enough 
 Adam It s called
categorical perception 
and that is a much more
efficient way
of processing information 
and of course
that s why
the brain does it 
But autistic children 
they hang on to those
absolute qualities
for longer 
For people like Derek 
and since he s not only
got those fantastically
vivid absolute memories 
he s also learned
the rules of music
but it s built on this 
on this foundation of perceptual
vividness that
we can only grasp at 
 Michael While most people
would find it impossible
to identify all
of the individual notes
in a or note chord 
Derek is able to do
this with ease 
which means
he can decipher more notes
than he can play at once
with two hands 
So we could do that 
If I 
Actually I have 
I have hands 
 We could combine 
 Yes yes yeah 
So right so if you play those
two notes with that hand 
 Michael Yup 
 And those two with that hand 
And we ll count for it okay 
One two three four 
 There you are 
 Michael What was
all the fiddling 
 Adam Well the fiddling
was to make it 
because he couldn t reach them
all at the same time 
 Michael Right 
 Adam So his 
he was splitting them up 
 Michael He s just playing 
but they were all 
they were all in there 
He just couldn t all play
them at once 
But as amazing
as his musical ear is 
Derek s cognitive abilities
are less than rudimentary 
 Adam Derek should we do
some more chords 
 Derek We ll do some
more chords Adam 
 So can you play this for me 
 Derek Yes Adam 
Ready 
Good And do you know how many
notes there are Derek 
 Derek I m not sure 
 Adam Have a guess 
How many do you think 
 Is it one 
 Adam Yeah 
a bit more than one 
 So there s one 
 One two three 
four five six 
 Adam 
Six weren t there Right 
 Derek There s six Adam 
 Adam Good 
Now try this one then Derek 
Ready and 
 Derek Is it one note Adam 
 Adam No there are five 
One two three four five 
 Derek 
It is one two three 
four five Adam 
 Michael Tell me more
about how limited
Derek s everyday abilities are 
Derek finds
almost everything
that you or I do without
thinking really difficult 
So self care 
things like getting dressed 
getting washed in the morning
are tricky for him 
So all those things
that we take for granted 
he finds really difficult 
 Cynthia Derek 
 Derek Yes 
 Cynthia We ll have
to clean your mouth 
 Derek Could you clean
my mouth now Cynthia 
 Cynthia Yes 
Can you come to the sink 
 Derek I can come
to the sink 
 Adam And in fact 
 years on we re saying
Well does it really
matter if Derek
can t put his socks
on himself 
there are other things in life 
And and yet when
he touches the piano 
everything s reversed 
So things that we would find
inconceivably difficult 
Derek does it as easy
as breathing 
And if you ask him 
Derek how d you do that 
he has no idea 
any more than you
or I understand
how we breathe
or how we speak or 
 It s purely intuitive 
 playing ragtime 
 Michael In addition
to entertaining people
with his remarkable abilities 
Derek offers valuable insight
to scientists
who study the mind 
What do you think Derek
is helping us learn
about this thing
in our head 
I think what
Derek s example tells us
is the almost infinite
capacity of the human brain
to not only survive
but thrive in incredibly
difficult circumstances 
And Derek s potential
really was no different
from anyone else s 
There s no one in his family
who were particularly musical 
So in a sense you could say
that we all have
Derek s potential
when we re born 
But fortunately of course 
we don t have his disadvantages
and what gave Derek
his massive advantage
is at the cost
of his disadvantages 
Autism still
isn t well understood 
One of the many theories
for the cause
of autistic people s heightened
sensory awareness
is that it s at least partially
due to an abnormality
in the brain s left hemisphere 
permitting a vast amount
of sensory details
to enter
the brain s awareness 
Neurotypical brains may receive
all the same sensory details
but block them from awareness 
In fact some psychologists
have even proposed
that all of us
have savant skills
lying dormant in our brains 
And they may be on to something 
because in extraordinarily
rare cases 
people can actually acquire
savant skills 
A very small number of people
have what is called
Acquired Savant Syndrome 
These are people who suffered
some sort of brain damage
as adults and their brain damage
actually unlocked skills
and abilities
that weren t there before 
Jason Padgett
is one such acquired savant 
After a brain injury
left him with damage
to his visual cortex 
Jason started seeing precise
geometric patterns
in everything around him 
which led to an intuitive
perception of math
and physics
that he never had before 
How did you get
a brain injury 
So I was at a karaoke bar 
and as we left 
these two guys
that were in there singing
attacked me from behind 
They smashed me
in the back of the head 
Well I just heard
this deep thud 
saw a little
puff of white light 
which I later found out
was my brain
bouncing on the inside
of my skull 
I didn t know where I was 
how I got there 
why I was being attacked 
 Michael So now you
have Akinetopsia 
meaning you see
the world now in frames 
 What does that mean 
 In discreet picture frames 
When I say discreetly 
I mean seeing one picture
and another picture 
So imagine like anybody
watching TV right now 
they can hit pause
and pause again and see
the picture frame
by frame by frame 
It s just like that 
but in real time 
It also makes everything look
slightly pixelated 
So boundaries of objects
don t look curved
like smooth curves anymore 
They look like
they have these tiny
little straight line edges 
Are you seeing me
that way right now 
Yes So like 
if you re not moving 
it s more like a picture
on a picture on a picture 
so it s not nearly
as profound 
but when something moves
like this 
then it s much more profound 
So after the injury 
you have all these
perceptual changes 
What makes you decide
that you need
to start drawing 
So at the time 
I had no way to describe
what I was seeing
in any terms
except for to draw it 
I started trying
to define things
with triangles
and straight lines 
Geometry is to me
is the one thing everything has 
even nothing 
Empty space is geometry 
It just seemed obvious 
I mean the universe
is math for me 
 Michael Are these
thoughts that you would ve
had before the injury 
No not at all 
Never even contemplated
this type of stuff and now
I can t stop thinking about it
and I wound up going
to the mall 
So I m sitting there
eating this sandwich
and I m drawing 
and this guy next to me 
he says he s a physicist 
And he goes 
It looks like you re doing
some sort of math there 
And I started telling him 
you know my ideas 
And he says It sounds to me
like you re trying to describe
space time and limits 
And things that
I didn t understand
what he was talking about 
He goes But you re doing it
in layman terms
and I ve never heard anybody
try to do that before 
It turns out
it was integrals 
What I was doing
was integrals and calculus 
You re now pursuing
an education in math 
 Jason Yes 
 So would you say that
you re still the same person
who existed
before the injury 
or did you become
a different individual 
I feel like I ve
had two different lives 
Before the injury I didn t have
any background in math 
I didn t even have algebra 
I didn t even know
that you could graph a line 
All I did was party
and chase girls 
It was a very shallow 
almost blissfully
ignorant life 
Do you think
that these abilities
were always in your brain
and got somehow
unlocked by the injury 
or did the injury
give you something new 
I believe that
we all have this in us 
You know people think
that I got hit in the head
and just magically
got good at math
but a lot of it
is your brain gets damaged
and you re forced to see
the world differently 
and by seeing the world
differently 
it makes you think
differently 
 Michael We can learn
so much from divergent minds 
whether it would be someone
like Jason
who developed
from an accident
as an adult 
Hello Ashleigh 
 Ashleigh Hello Derek 
 Derek How are you 
 or someone like Derek 
whose divergence came
from complications
at birth 
 Adam One of Derek s
great strengths is working
with other disabled people
and disabled children 
They love him 
Beautiful Ashleigh 
Well done 
Derek is a hero 
particularly amongst
the learning disabled 
For anyone with severe
learning difficulties 
to have a public life 
to travel
all over the world 
to meet hundreds of people 
to have acclaim
from millions of people
on the internet is 
he s unique
in that perspective 
He s a trailblazer 
but we should never forget
that he s part of a population
that s much bigger
and tends to be hidden away
from society 
Derek raises
important questions
about the diversity of minds 
Autistic minds
like all divergent minds
are not alien 
they re human minds
and they provide windows
into how we all think 
feel and behave 
A complete brain science
should be able to account
for all kinds
of minds and brains 
As long as some minds
remain a mystery 
so too will all minds 
 Adam Improv 
Here we go 
 humming 
﻿ clangs 
This is Inuyama Japan 
a historic city
home to Japan s oldest
original wooden castle 
It is also home
to Kyoto University s
Primate Research Institute 
Here a group of chimpanzees
have been trained
to play a game that exposes
something shocking
about their memories 
This is going
to blow your mind 
Here is how it works 
Take a look at these numbers 
 
Remember where they are 
because they re about
to disappear 
Can you point to where
each number used to be
in numerical order 
Probably It s pretty easy 
But what if we
make it harder 
Get ready to point to where
each number was in order 
now 
If you feel like you didn t
have enough time
to memorize the screen 
that s fine 
It s nothing
to be ashamed of 
Or is it 
Here is a chimpanzee
taking exactly that long
to memorize the same
arrangement 
Nailed it 
Each of these puzzles
is completely new
to the chimpanzee 
but just a glance
is all it needs
to completely capture
all the numbers 
How can a chimpanzee s memory
be so much better
than ours 
Well one theory
is that we humans
are worse at this task
because we can talk 
What makes humans different
from other animals 
Well one thing is language 
We have the cognitive ability
to communicate not just about
what s happening now 
but also about what did happen 
and what could happen 
We can tell stories 
and it s awesome 
But if language is so good 
why didn t any other animal
develop it like we did 
A good approach
to this question
is one that looks
at how we are different
from those who were almost us 
Around million years ago 
there were no chimpanzees
and there were no humans 
But there were CHLCAs 
an acronym which stands for
Chimpanzee Human
Last Common Ancestor 
Like us 
CHLCAs didn t have
great natural offenses
or defenses 
protective shells or claws 
fangs or venom 
So living in the safety
of the trees was great 
Those who stayed became
the chimps we know today 
But for reasons we re still
not quite sure of 
some of the CHLCAs decided
to venture down to the savanna 
Without appropriate
physical abilities 
things like cooperation 
imagining new strategies 
and the assigning of roles
were necessary for survival 
all of which are easier
if you have
a rich collection of symbols
that can refer to things
across time 
language 
Many different types
of creatures emerged
with varying adaptations 
But today only one member
of the family remains 
Us 
Language as we know it may have
been one of the strategies
that kept us alive
in the savanna 
But where did it move in 
The brains of those
who developed language
and those who didn t
aren t totally different 
A brand new brain structure
didn t just pop into existence 
Instead anatomy used
for other tasks
must have been sacrificed 
And as it turns out 
for beautiful reasons 
detailed short term memory
may have been
a fair thing to lose
in return for language 
This trade off
between memory and language
is the Cognitive Tradeoff
Hypothesis 
The Cognitive Tradeoff
Hypothesis
is the culmination
of decades of work
by one of the world s leading
primatologists 
Professor Tetsuro Matsuzawa
of Kyoto University s
Founded in 
the institute was created
for scientific research
in association with the nearby
Japan Monkey Center 
The collaborative centers house
over species
and nearly primates who
live and play in open spaces 
Look at monkeys 
 monkeys chitter 
Is there a baby
on that one 
 Michael Six months 
 Tetsuro Yes 
 gibbers 
That s where they live 
Can you do it 
 grunts 
Dr Matsuzawa has spent
over years
researching
non human primates 
He splits his time
between fieldwork
in the West African country
of Guinea 
and here in Japan 
where he and his colleagues
have developed
a chimpanzee habitat
designed to mimic life
in the wild 
This habitat is home to Skylab 
a working laboratory
set high atop the chimpanzee 
climbing structure 
In this open air lab 
chimpanzees are free
to come and go as they please 
And this is how you move 
If they decide to stay 
they participate
in cognitively enriching tasks
designed to mimic
foraging behavior 
When the chimpanzees are
interested in participating 
they enter one of Skylab s
specially designed
computer booths 
where a camera uses
facial recognition software
to recognize them
and select a test
based that particular chimp s
current familiarity
with the task 
Each trial takes about as long
as it would for a chimp
to forage a single bite 
And each morsel
of food they get
is accounted for
in their diet 
Do the doors open
when they approach 
No human even needs to be 
So what is for us
a great way to collect data 
is for them an experience
similar in many ways
to what they would be doing
Dr Matsuzawa has been running
memory tests like these
on chimpanzees since 
His research has shown
the phenomenal
and nearly photographic
short term memory
of these primates 
Two of the most famous chimps
at the PRI are Ai 
named after the Japanese word
for love 
and her son Ayumu 
whose name means walk 
What can we learn
about ourselves
by studying chimpanzees
like them 
Well I want to find out 
If we and chimpanzees
come from a common ancestor 
what can explain the split
where the chimpanzees
don t seem to need
or to develop language
like we did 
Why would that happen 
Was it an accident 
Ah ha 
Our habitat 
provided a pressure
to develop language 
 That s incredible 
 Mm 
So in a way we should be
really grateful
that our ancestors
were so weak 
they got pushed
out of the trees 
 thumping 
 Bang bang 
 Michael I d invite you to be
a part of this interview 
but you don t have language 
Right now 
Quick decisions 
Our ancestors didn t have
that same pressure 
Hmm 
 Michael The Cognitive
Tradeoff Hypothesis
suggests that in the dangerous
world beyond the trees 
early humans needed
to teach each other
and use abstract symbols
that could refer
not just to the immediate
here and now 
but to hypotheticals
and generalities 
Making room for that kind
of abstract thinking
meant sacrificing the immediate
and detailed memory
of their ancestors 
I m able to imagine
past and future 
I m able to describe things
in an abstract way 
And I don t need the details 
because I have the label 
So it seems like a pretty good
trade off 
What a great message right 
Sharing is what makes us us 
I would love to see your
working memory tests
on chimpanzees in action 
I would also really love
to participate myself
and see how well I can do
compared to a chimpanzee 
Have you ever had
a human and a chimpanzee
compete like that
together 
 hooting 
 Michael They re excited
 about the idea too 
 gibbering 
An opportunity to do the memory
task just like a chimpanzee
is really special 
Who knows how it will go 
Let s see who shows up 
 clapping 
 Michael Yeah 
You re really good
at this Ai 
Looks like today 
it will be celebrity chimp Ai 
Ai is older now 
and just like in humans 
her cognitive abilities
have decreased with time 
So I may actually
stand a chance 
To face off against Ai 
I will be sitting in the booth
next to her 
Normally her son Ayumu
plays against her 
But today well 
she s in for some Michael time 
I m not your child though 
am I 
The tests are going
to get harder as we go along 
How will my memory compare
to that of a chimp
who never made
the same cognitive trade off 
 exhales 
In the first round 
the task is to remember
where each of the three numbers
are in numerical order 
But here s the trick 
as soon as I touch
one of them on the screen 
the other two will
be covered by solid squares 
so I can no longer see
where they are 
Now well 
it s up to my memory 
 Tetsuro 
Okay let s go 
If I make a mistake 
I get an error noise
like this 
 buzzer 
 while a correct answer
sounds like this 
 computer chirps 
When the chimpanzee
gets it right 
they are rewarded
with apples 
The human me well 
just gets the bragging rights 
I m not getting apples 
You really actually have
to focus more than I expected 
Almost messed that one up 
How did Michael do 
 
On my first run 
I ve managed to beat Ai 
What is the next task 
How many symbols 
Whoa 
This is a lot harder 
This game is similar
to the last 
but starts a little bit
This time three numbers
appear on a blank screen 
but as soon as I touch
the first one 
the entire screen
is covered in boxes 
Whew 
Ai 
you having fun 
 Whoa 
 grunts 
Ai is used to Ayumu her son 
playing the game beside her 
so my presence
may be throwing her off 
I m here for moral support Ai 
It was fun squaring off
against Ai 
but I want to see how I would
do against her son Ayumu 
I m ready 
Okay 
 Michael Ayumu is currently
Matsuzawa s best pupil 
able to ace the memory tests
at blazingly fast speeds 
But today Ayumu is not
interested in mental combat 
He s busy flirting
with some young ladies
who live with him
here at the PRI 
And since free choice
is the guiding principle
of Matsuzawa s research 
we can t make him join us 
The good news is that
Ayumu doesn t need to be here
for me to compete
against him 
The game can be presented
to me just as Ayumu does it 
with nine numerals 
Let s see if my luck
is the same against Ayumu
as it was against Ai 
Even when I take time
I can t do it right 
Okay more time 
I thought I had that one 
It takes a long time to memorize
nine numerals positions 
It s embarrassing
how long this takes me 
I can do this one 
You don t need
to laugh about it 
Thirteen 
I got better yeah 
because you were pressuring me 
Jesus 
Six times worse 
six times slower 
Yeah I would love to 
 Michael This is the most
difficult test 
I have to remember all nine
numbers in numerical order
at Ayumu s speed 
which is to say 
I have to do
what I could
barely do before 
but now I have
to memorize them all
within the amount of time
it takes to blink 
So I get half a second
to prepare 
I m going to prove you wrong 
As a reminder 
this is how Ayumu performs 
which is standard
for a young chimp 
You got to be kidding me 
 That s way too fast 
I got the first three 
It s like a joke 
I don t know where the is 
It s too fast 
Trying to think of this
very holistically 
 clears throat 
After the first three 
if I see them 
I m just having to guess 
Yeah It s impossible 
Well I hope this was
helpful for you 
It was the first time you had
had a chimpanzee and a human
together in the booth 
What do you think 
If you ever need me
to study as a primate 
 I give myself to you 
And we need to make sure
to preserve them 
 They re already endangered 
And yet they are our closest
link to understanding
what we came from
and where we might go 
Mm 
 Michael It s like taking care
of your family 
 Tetsuro Mm right 
 Michael Quite literally 
 snarling 
The fact that humans alone
use complex
symbolic language
doesn t make us any better
than any other species 
It just means that the path
we took required it 
In fact in some ways
we aren t better 
Today we study those
who took different paths
as a way to learn
more about ourselves 
If we lose them 
we lose part of our story 
where we came from 
who we are 
and who we can be
 shrieks 
on Mind Field 
I will die 
But should I 
I want to perform
a reverse exorcism 
There was like
a glowing figure man 
 man 
I would love to do the Stanford
prison experiment again 
There let s blast them again 
Number three 
 electricity hums 
Have you ever had a human
and a chimpanzee compete
like that together 
You having fun 
 No not really 
I am going to make
my hometown
function like a brain 
 cheering 
Doing a good moral deed can
actually make you more likely
to do something immoral 
We re going to see if we
can get people to allow a child
to take the blame
for a crime they committed 
 How old are you son 
 Twelve 
 guard We re going to need
to talk to the police 
This facility is where you both
cryo preserve people
and store them 
We have patients
in these tanks 
We re offering an unknown
extension of human lifespan 
 Michael You spied
on their dream 
 Michael We received a message
from outer space 
Please figure out
what this message is saying 
 man You ready 
 I m ready 
Hey I have to leave
and go over to the next episode 
but you can come with me 
Click below to check out
the next episode of Mind Field 
I ll see you there 
﻿How do you get information
from someone who wants
to keep it from you 
Somewhere locked
inside their brain
could be the truth
about a crime
or the plan
for a terrorist attack
or the password
to a bank account
or nuclear codes 
To get information 
we often resort to violence 
but that often doesn t work
and can cause a person
to close off even more 
But that s not to say
there aren t other ways
of getting people to talk
or even of getting their brains
to talk for them 
In this episode 
I m going to be injected
with a truth serum 
I m going to coerce people
into giving false confessions 
and I m going to try
to hide the truth
from a mind reading machine 
What s the best way
to get the truth
or detect a lie 
Let s see if anybody
can dig out the secrets
I ve got locked up in my head 
 siren wailing 
 indistinct radio chatter 
It s a classic scene
in spy movies 
Someone captures someone
they want information from 
they inject them
with truth serum 
and the person spills
all their secrets 
The serum used in almost
all of these movies
is Sodium Pentothal 
which is an actual drug
that inhibits brain activity 
It was first used
as a painkiller 
but was found to work better
as an anti anxiety drug 
It dulls your thoughts 
making it harder
to perform cognitive tasks 
including the task
of making up a lie 
The use of truth serums
began in 
when Dr Robert House 
a physician in Texas 
realized that scopolamine 
a drug given to women
during childbirth 
had the effect
of getting them to talk
without reservation 
Another drug midazolam 
has been used to treat
Iraq War burn victims
who suffer from PTSD 
Midazolam helps reduce
their inhibitions 
allowing them
to talk more freely
about their experiences 
Midazolam is also
one of the drugs used
in lethal injections 
including several
botched executions 
I arranged to be injected
with midazolam
to see if it could make me
spill my guts 
 cars revving 
 Dr Malek 
This is the midazolam 
the medicine
we are going to use 
This is enough
to put an elephant to sleep 
So we ll have to make it
very very very dilute
and then give you
very very small amount
 of the diluted drug 
 Please yes 
You will be
comfortable and happy 
It s euphoric 
You will feel very cool 
But I also wanna
keep some secrets 
That is 
it remains
to be determined 
Okay Michael um we ll
introduce you to Dr Pavlo 
 Michael Nice to meet you 
 Dr Pavlo 
How are you doing 
 Good 
 Michael Dr Pavlo
is a police psychologist
and an expert
in interrogations 
Have you started the drip yet 
Uh we would like to start
with the amount
of one uh milligram 
 Michael Dr Pavlo s objective
was to get me to admit
to certain information 
one that my sister s name
is Melissa
and two 
that my job is hosting
Mind Field and Vsauce 
My objective 
not to admit the truth 
Are you feeling
more relaxed in your body 
I m feeling warm
all over 
It s amazing how quickly
this came into effect 
Let me just ask you
a couple of basic questions 
 I love to 
 Dr Pavlo Okay 
Where are you 
 What town What city 
 Uh Pasadena 
How old are you 
 Thirty one 
 Do you have any siblings 
How old
is your sister Melissa 
Uh 
That That s not her name 
 Dr Pavlo 
What do you do for a living 
I am
a choreographer by trade 
What might be something
I m familiar with that you did 
 Michael Have you heard
of um The Lion King 
 On Broadway 
 Dr Pavlo I have 
I think he needs
an extra dose 
 Absolutely 
 That means I got them right 
You are too sharp 
 Michael How much
have I had total so far 
 Dr Malek Two milligrams 
Question for you 
How do you feel now 
I feel like in order
to feel like this 
I would have had
to have had 
six drinks 
Tell me about Mind Field 
 Mine field 
 Dr Pavlo Yeah 
Mine field 
Uh they re 
they re terrible 
There are places
that we ve got mines
still littered throughout
the um the land 
Cambodia Vietnam 
You know I think
you misinterpreted my question 
YouTube show Mind Field
that you host 
Tell me about that 
Scientific 
I am somewhat familiar with it 
 clears throat 
 Can he get another dose 
Okay We re just gonna
get you even more relaxed 
Tell me your occupation 
I m a choreographer 
And siblings 
I have a sibling
in uh Colorado 
What s your favorite food 
 Michael Uh rotisserie 
uh Greek doner 
Does your sister Melissa
like that too 
She ll eat the meat by itself 
Trying to get Michael to admit
that he has a sister 
Melissa was no easy feat 
Luckily 
he was anesthetized enough
and did admit that
he has a sister Melissa 
You ever think about being
an uncle or a father yourself 
Do you want children 
Ah I would love
to have children yeah 
My my wife and I are trying 
but I m always doing stuff
like this you know 
 Dr Pavlo Yeah yeah 
 It s like Hey honey 
do you wanna make
a little uh baby 
And I m like 
I got to go sighs 
get interrogated
and pumped
full of midazolam 
Are you gonna
give him anymore 
Yeah because I 
He s not sedated enough 
I could do another one 
 Dr Malek This would probably
the last dose I wanna give him 
 Dr Pavlo Yes 
Do most people
at this dose fall asleep 
 yawns 
How you doing Michael 
Good 
Feeling a little bit
more tired now 
Yeah heavy 
And who s the president 
President P 
President Trump 
President Trump Where are we 
What city are we in 
Yo Pasadena 
Which show do you like
to do more 
Mind Field or Vsauce 
Which one
do you enjoy more 
 yawns Vsauce 
 Dr Pavlo Vsauce 
 Why 
Because they can be
whatever I want them to be 
and there s no
executive in control 
By the way my eyes
were closed weren t they 
 Michael And I didn t realize
that you were still a real
person asking me questions 
I think had it
not have been for the drug 
there s no way he would
have admitted anything 
Before you were pretending
to be a choreographer 
weren t you 
No it s the drugs 
but I really am
a choreographer 
After a few minutes 
he got right back on track 
He s very strong willed
and really believes
in what he s doing
and was able
to maintain the charade 
Okay You re done 
How do you feel 
I feel ready to drive 
 Just kidding 
 Michael While midazolam
lowered my inhibitions
and my ability
to lie consistently 
truth serums raise
ethical concerns
about one s right
against self incrimination 
Furthermore larger scale
studies have shown
that truth serums
can cause people
and fabricate memories 
So truth serums
are not very reliable 
but what about the techniques
used by the police 
Michael 
let me take a shot at this 
Look we re all friends here 
If I was in your shoes 
I d probably do the same thing 
You re being too easy
on this scum 
Your fingerprints are
all over the crime scene 
You make me sick 
if you get him too scared 
he ll shut down 
We only wanna scare him enough 
And after I do that 
he s gonna
give you relief 
and then we ll do that
over and over and over again 
You re gonna be taken on
an emotional roller coaster
that will
deplete the finite
cognitive resources
you ll need to keep
withholding information 
I confess 
It really does work 
You see at one moment 
I m terrified
but then I m comforted 
The constant shifting
from one emotion to another
fogs my critical thinking
until I might confess to a crime
I didn t even commit 
It s called
the fear then relief response 
The good cop bad cop method
of interrogation
evolved out of a psychological
manipulation procedure
called the Reid technique 
developed in the s
and used broadly
by police departments
since the s 
Now under the Reid technique 
interrogators first assess
whether a suspect
is withholding the truth 
If they think
the suspect is lying 
interrogators then move
to the second stage
in which they seek a confession 
Now critics
of the Reid technique say
that the first phase
isn t reliable enough 
and that often 
someone who is
completely innocent
makes it to the second stage
where it s assumed
they re guilty
and police begin
seeking a confession 
And they often get it 
But why would anyone
falsely confess 
Well to find out 
I decided to learn
how to make someone confess
to a crime they didn t commit 
 Michael Dr Melissa Russano
is an expert
in investigative research 
including the process
and confession 
Tell me about
false confessions
and why people make them 
In a nutshell 
people confess to crimes
that they didn t commit
because they come to believe
that it s in their best interest
to falsely confess 
and that s really
counterintuitive 
Right because confessing
is the worst thing
to do right 
Like that s what you need
to avoid at all costs 
Yes when you re not
in the situation
of being convinced that
it s actually your best option 
But that s kind of
what I wanna do today 
I wanna see how easy it is
to get a false
confession from someone 
How do I do that 
 Dr Russano One way
is minimization techniques 
You ve got
to get them to believe
that their best option
out of this situation
to make this end
is to confess 
You can say 
Look I really think
it s in your
best interest to cooperate 
There are
other techniques as well
 like maximization right 
So they have
to believe that
if they don t confess 
things are gonna be worse 
um that the punishment
will likely be more severe 
and so their best option
in the moment is to 
is to confess to you 
One other technique
is befriending them 
um where you re
lulling the suspect
into a false
sense of security
to trust you 
What about making a deal 
So police officers
are not allowed
to um make explicit offers
of leniency or a deal 
So you cannot make
any promises 
but you can say 
it s in your best interest
to cooperate 
You don t have
to explicitly say something
for the message
to be communicated 
With Melissa s tools in mind 
I was ready to try to get
a false confession 
 woman All right 
 Michael 
Our subjects answered
our online ad
offering participants 
to test a new logic exam
for an educational institution 
They didn t realize
that the institution was fake
and the other participants
taking the test
were actually actors
working for us 
 woman It s a pretty
standard release form 
 Michael Before the test 
the participants were required
to sign a document
stating that they would be
under breach of contract
if they cheated on the test 
When you work
on the individual questions 
it s very important
that you work alone 
Don t talk about
what you re doing 
don t share answers 
Good luck 
See you soon 
 Michael The subjects didn t
know that there were several
hidden cameras around
and that we were watching
everything unfold
from another room 
During the testing 
the participants and our actors
did not share information 
At no time
did cheating take place 
I m gonna collect these
and put them in the database 
and I ll be right back
to start the next phase 
okay guys 
 Thank you 
 Michael I wore an earpiece
so that Melissa could guide me
during the entire process 
A few minutes later 
it was time
to set up a false accusation 
So we actually
might have a problem 
Um I ll need to speak
to each of you separately 
So James could you
come with me just outside 
 Sure 
 I ll take these now 
And um Nicole 
you can
just wait right here 
 Awesome Thank you 
You got to give them
enough time to plausibly
 be talking to you 
 Believe that
I m talking to him 
And calling the director 
 Hi Nicole 
 Hello 
You and James both had
the same wrong answer
for the triangle problem 
It looks to me like
there was information sharing 
Like you guys spoke
to one another about the answer
 on that problem 
 I didn t I didn t do it 
We didn t talk at all
on the individual problems 
I kept my eyes on my paper
because I knew
that would probably
throw off the results 
If I just write out here 
like 
I admit
that I shared answers 
I don t remember talking
to him at all about 
 like while we re doing
the individual 
First I tried to minimize
the consequences of confessing 
I really think
it s in your best interest 
I really think it s
in your best interest
to sign this stating
that you admit
to sharing the information 
I honestly believe
that that is 
But I did not 
Look I don t know
what s going on here 
I really 
that s I don t know 
 I came here to help 
 I understand
what you re saying and 
And I never said 
like Hey there s 
 Megan 
 Please let me finish 
because I don t appreciate 
like over talking and stuff 
 Michael I think I may have
come on too aggressively 
Next I tried to maximize
the consequences
of not confessing 
What we re looking at
is is possible
breach of contract here 
If he comes down here 
he s going to be
a lot more upset 
If the director
has to come down here 
he s gonna be
even more upset
and annoyed
than he already is 
 It did not happen 
And I my 
I put that on my dad 
and I have my dad
around my neck so 
 Michael Some people
were just too strong willed 
Finally I tried
to befriend the suspect 
I also understand
you re a nice guy
and like sharing information
or helping someone
with a problem
is the nice thing to do 
It s what we normally do 
But I didn t share
any information 
so I can t sign
that document 
 Michael But this guy
didn t want to be my friend 
I struck out with all
of these test subjects 
But after these
failed attempts 
I was ready to put
everything I had learned
into the next encounter 
Is there a strategy
I should use 
I think that
you should proceed
with making sure that you re
not overly confrontational 
 And making sure that she
sees you as someone
who she can trust
your advice 
and so I would 
I would proceed
with that kind of approach 
Okay I m going in 
Thanks for waiting 
 No problem 
 So 
I think we do have a problem 
I was looking through
your individual questionnaires 
 Deja Mm hmm 
 And you guys both had
on the triangle problem 
 So it was kind of
this weird like 
okay what s going on 
Like statistically 
what are the chances
that two people are gonna have
these very unique answers 
 Deja Mm hmm 
So I called
the project director
to see what to do
because if you know 
this is a sign
that information were shared
during the individual section 
that s a major problem
for the study right 
We didn t look
at each other s stuff 
That was like 
We were like on 
Like we didn t ask
each other anything 
we didn t 
like you know 
We didn t talk to each other
the whole entire time 
So I don t know how
we got the same answer 
But I m like a hundred
percent sure that that was 
like the answer
that I came up with 
 Michael Deja was resolute
about her innocence 
so I changed tactics and
told her what the consequences
of sharing information
could be 
And that s a really big deal
because through this grant 
we need to have
integrity of the data 
we need to always obey
the rules of the experiment 
and it could even be
a breach of the contract
that you guys signed
when you came to do this study 
 Michael Deja now knows
the stakes that are involved 
My job is to convince her
that I have her best interest
at heart 
I have to call
the director back right 
And I could either tell him
I don t know what s going on 
we can t proceed like 
 you need to come down here 
I don t know
who he s going to involve 
 The easier 
 I don t think any sharing
was involved though 
All I know is that I can t
explain what happened 
 The easier option
is to just document that 
um information was shared 
 Okay So if I write out 
um you know 
that I shared 
uh the answer 
 But we didn t 
 to the triangle 
Is that crazy to say
that we didn t
share answers though 
Because I m like 
what he s saying
or if he said that
he looked at my answer
or we didn t 
Deja wasn t quite convinced 
So the next tactic
was to minimize
the impact of confessing 
exactly how it happened 
I just know that
we ve got to figure out
the best way forward 
 This is so weird 
 I don t know exactly
It looks like
information sharing 
 If you just tell us
that that happened 
 Say that 
 then what we can do is
I can call the director back
and say that you guys
are cooperating
 and I know him 
That s the best thing 
I mean it s not true
but I ll sign it 
Okay If you sign
and date it 
I can go and call him back 
and I ll try to get you
out of here 
It s very weird 
but 
 Thank you very much Deja 
I will be 
I ll be right back 
 Thanks for your patience 
So you did an excellent job
of communicating to her
that it was
in her best interest 
that the best way
was to confess 
But it feels so bad 
 Of course 
 I mean she knows
the seriousness 
She knows
that it s a lie 
I mean I didn t cheat 
I did not cheat 
Those were
all my answers 
Okay Uh 
this concludes the study 
I m gonna give you
a debrief now 
uh to tell you
about what we re studying 
 So first of all 
you re not in trouble 
The other guy here
works for us 
 Deja Okay 
 This is not a study
of logic problems 
it s a study of interrogation
and false confessions 
Good one 
You falsely confessed today 
Mm hmm I see that 
I feel mad at myself
because I m usually
the one who like 
you know just 
sticks to what 
you know what s right 
I try to at least 
So what happened today 
It was just scary I guess 
because it s an environment
I ve never been in before
and then just like 
all the pressure 
It was just like 
Uh well I guess 
I should just sign it
and say that I did it 
 Michael Despite knowing
she was innocent
and knowing she was admitting
to breaching a contract 
Deja signed a confession
that in a true criminal case
could be used as evidence
in a trial against her 
Imagine if
there were consequences
 and this
was a real crime 
 how easy it is
to get someone to confess
to something without
even punching them
or waterboarding them 
just being nice
and tell them that
it s in their best interest 
That s messed up actually 
 Michael Isn t it 
 That s really crazy 
 Cause there s a lot
of people in prison
for crimes they didn t do 
The Innocence Project 
an organization dedicated
to uncovering
miscarriages of justice 
estimates that people
are currently falsely
imprisoned in the U S 
The number one cause
is faulty eyewitness testimony 
and the number two cause 
false confession 
Interrogation techniques
are unreliable 
They can fail to produce
truthful information
from suspects
who are good at lying 
and perhaps worse 
they can manipulate
innocent suspects
to confess crimes
they ve never committed 
But neuroscientists
may have discovered a method
for extracting the truth
that s impervious
to good liars
and bad interrogators 
Dr Peter Rosenfeld
and his team
at Northwestern University 
including Ph D candidate
Anne Ward 
a high tech method
for lie detection 
You guys brought
with you today
a P based
concealed information test 
How does that work
and how is it different
than a polygraph
or traditional
verbal only
interrogation techniques 
Well we re looking at 
um physiological responses
of the brain
in response to information
that s presented 
And if the information
is meaningful 
like the murder weapon
that a guilty person used 
he will recognize it 
a brain signature to it 
And so the machine
that we brought with us
is basically an EEG machine 
So the way my brain 
your brain 
all of our brains
respond to things
that are meaningful
that we recognize is different
than the way it responds
to novel meaningless things 
 Has this been used
in a court 
Has it been used
by a prosecution 
Not in court 
There are some
Fifth Amendment issues
as far as betraying 
um yourself 
based on your brain waves 
But you could use it
for witnesses 
or you could use it
within companies
that are already using
polygraph methods 
Okay Well I m excited
to see this in action 
I m gonna step out 
you guys are gonna prepare
the first test 
 Excellent All right 
We re ready
for the test 
Thank you
for joining me 
Hannah from Vsauce 
Wren from Corridor Digital 
So one of us today
is going to be a thief 
 Michael Per Dr Rosenfeld s
instructions 
we randomly determined
who would be the thief
by seeing whoever
drew the green chip 
Three two one 
 gasps 
 Hannah s the thief 
Oh my God I knew it 
So Hannah go on in 
 Look at the item 
 Hannah Okay 
In this real world scenario
designed by Dr Rosenfeld 
the designated thief
actually takes the item 
handles it 
and gets a good look at it 
This activity causes the item
to register
in the subject s mind 
so they can t help
but recognize it later 
The other subjects
are also required
to enter the room and sign in
to prove they were there 
But never get a look
at the stolen item 
And of course Dr Rosenfeld
and Anne have no idea
who the thief is 
Then each of us is tested 
Go ahead
and take a seat here
 and we ll get you all set up 
Basically I m just gonna
put a couple electrodes
behind your ears
and a couple on your face 
and then um 
the EEG cap on your head 
What you re gonna do
is you re gonna use
these two mice
in front of you 
 to respond to the images
that you see on the screen 
So you ll see an image 
a string of numbers 
an image 
a string of numbers 
Anytime you see an image 
no matter what it is 
you re gonna
press this button 
All right Are you ready 
The images we were shown
contained a variety
of jewelry items 
including the stolen one 
Of course Wren and I
hadn t seen any of them before 
Hannah didn t consciously react
to any of them 
But would her brain waves
reveal
the one item she recognizes 
It was time for the results 
So here we are 
Have you reached
a conclusion 
Well based on what we know 
and we know that
the stolen item was a watch 
And so we looked
at the brain waves
in response to the watch
in comparison
to the brain waves
in response
to other things 
And uh we have
two average brain waves 
uh or event related
potentials in each frame 
The black one
is the average
brain wave response
to the watch 
The red trace there
is the response
to the other stimuli
all averaged together 
We look for
the peak to peak difference 
the peak down here 
versus the highest peak
following this peak 
And we measure that 
and it s rather obvious
that the biggest response
we found was 
uh Hannah s 
 Dr Rosenfeld 
And interesting thing Michael 
is that you had
a special response
to the watch in comparison
to the other items 
That would suggest
that there s something special
about that stimulus the watch 
that is meaningful to you 
Is it 
I collect watches 
I have about or 
of them 
But Hannah might not have
that kind of excuse 
I don t have
that many watches 
And out of three of you 
she definitely has
the biggest response 
So off to jail 
 Michael The P 
concealed information test
correctly identified
which one of us was a thief 
But in this next test 
I will be the only suspect 
and they will know
that I ve stolen something 
But the question will be 
what did I steal 
Inside this room
are seven boxes 
and inside those boxes
are seven different items
that I ve never seen 
My task is to open only one box
at random and steal that item 
We ve got a 
a camouflage hat 
And that s not all 
During this next test 
I will be implementing
countermeasures
to try to outsmart the test 
I will think
a very strong thought
every time something comes up
that s irrelevant 
Will that enable me
to create brain waves
powerful and dramatic enough
to not be distinguishable
from my response
to the actual item
I m trying to conceal 
 Anne 
 Anne Hello Welcome back 
I uh committed a crime 
 Michael Wish me luck 
because this time 
there will be punishments
like in the real world
where getting caught in a lie
can have consequences 
And my friend Adam Savage
was happy to advise me
on my punishment 
 Adam 
 Michael 
an EEG lie detection test 
 If I lose 
 there need to be stakes 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
Naturally I thought
of Chinese water torture 
which as you know
from personal experience 
is when someone is restrained
while water is dripped
on their forehead 
And then right after that 
I thought I know just the guy
 to talk to about this 
Because I 
I want it to be
actually something
that I m fearing and dreading 
So yeah 
we did an episode
on Chinese water torture
on Mythbusters 
and the creepiest thing
that happened
after we did this episode
was that I got an email
from someone
from a throwaway account 
He said 
We found that randomizing
when the drops occurred
was incredibly effective 
That anything that happens
on a regular periodicity
can become a type
of meditation 
and you can then
tune it out 
If you couldn t predict it 
you re he said 
We found we were able
to induce a psychotic break
within hours 
Sounds like
the stakes that I want 
 Thanks 
You re welcome sir 
So now under the threat
I was extra motivated
to beat the lie detector 
 Anne All right 
That is it 
I was trying
to think about all kinds
of frightening scenarios 
to tense up to make sure
I was really uncomfortable
the way I was sitting 
Well for most tests 
that would work 
But we will take a look
at this data and see 
 Michael Yes we will 
 what it shows 
Wow Okay 
I don t think they re going
to be able to figure out
what item I stole 
I really kept my mind active 
I was going crazy
with countermeasures 
I was sitting uncomfortably 
I was thinking about
all kinds of really
crazy things 
I was thinking about like 
What if I have
diarrhea right now 
How would that feel 
How do I hold it back 
And maybe I do have diarrhea 
All these things
that were sort of physical
in nature as well 
I thought a lot about death
and dying
and being dismembered 
And if they can get it right 
I would probably blame
witchcraft as well as science 
 Dr Rosenfeld Well it s 
I would say that s it 
Yeah okay 
 Dr Rosenfeld We re ready
to give him our best guess 
Hello 
 Michael Are you guys ready 
Let me ask you this 
First of all 
how confident do you feel 
Pretty confident 
What did I take 
The camo hat 
 Camo hat 
 Camo hat 
That s impressive 
Did you see any evidence
of countermeasures being used 
Not something I would swear to 
Even while
I was doing the test 
I thought you know what 
I m reacting too quickly
to the actual item 
I should also treat it
as though it s irrelevant 
I should treat them
all the same 
If you are consistently
reacting to all
of the irrelevance
with their specific
countermeasure responses
that you formed
in your mind 
they should produce
bigger P s also 
But the biggest will still be
produced by the camo hat 
even if you were
countering it also 
That means
I now have to be punished 
Science is improving
in its ability
to read people s minds 
And that raises some
difficult ethical dilemmas 
We would have nothing to fear
from perfect lie detectors
if the people using them
had perfect morals 
So the prospect of a
scientifically rigorous method
of extracting information 
while exciting 
is also terrifying 
As we continue to probe
interrogation methods
scientifically 
we have to also continue
to probe them ethically 
Its earliest description
comes from Italy
in the th century 
And the Chinese name
was added later
to make it sound
more mysterious 
Oh man these irregular drops
are supposed to drive you
slowly insane 
this is a lot less
about getting information
and more about punishment 
﻿Hey Mind Field Vanessa here 
Just kidding My name
is actually Michael 
That part when I said
that I was Vanessa 
that was a lie 
So you re welcome 
Humans love lies 
More precisely 
we love things
that aren t entirely true 
because we have to 
It s often all we have 
Completely proving something
can be difficult 
if not impossible 
So instead we have
the faith of the believer 
the confidence interval
of the scientist 
What we think we know 
we really only believe we know 
On this episode of Mind Field 
I m going to take a look at
a kind of lie
we tell ourselves 
And I m going to use belief
to turn a lie into a truth 
 theme music playing 
If I m going to harness
the power of belief 
I need to find a good way
to study belief and behavior 
So I m paying a visit to UCLA s
Dr Aaron Blaisdell 
who I worked with
on last season s
Greater Good
Trolley Problem episode 
 train whistle blowing 
Dr Blaisdell 
great to see you again 
Nice to see you again 
Thank you for your help
last season 
but I ve got this new thing
I want to look into 
I started thinking a lot
about belief
and how we form them 
Specifically beliefs about
what causes our behavior 
I want to be able
to break it down
and just look at how people
respond to the environment
around them
and how it changes
their belief 
Well a Skinner Box
is a great place to start 
because what
I tell my students is 
a Skinner Box 
for a psychologist
like myself 
is like a test tube
for a chemist 
Dr Skinner what are you
doing with this pigeon 
I m getting ready to
demonstrate a fundamental
principle of behavior 
Invented by Harvard
psychologist B F Skinner 
a Skinner Box is a chamber
in which animals
can be isolated and exposed to
carefully controlled stimuli 
In one of his
landmark experiments 
Skinner released food
to pigeons in the boxes
at regular intervals 
What he found was that
the pigeons seemed to believe
that whatever
they happened to be doing
just before the food came
actually caused the food
to appear 
and would then repeat
that behavior over and over 
for example hopping around
or spinning in circles 
Skinner called this
superstitious behavior 
So what do you want to do 
what s your dream test 
Basically a replication
of Skinner s superstitious
but instead of with pigeons 
with people 
I would love to see 
will people develop
their own sort of
superstitious rituals
or beliefs 
Have we done this
with people before 
I don t think
such a rigorous test
of this has been done 
I think primarily from
the literature I know 
it s pretty much pigeons 
B F Skinner s work
showed that if you
regularly deliver
a reward to a pigeon 
regardless of how
it actually acts 
the pigeon won t
figure that out 
Instead the pigeon will develop
superstitious behaviors
as if it thinks
it is in control 
despite the lack of
any evidence that it is 
But what about humans 
Watching people form
new superstitions
might show us how
beliefs are created 
but here s the thing 
You can t just put a person
in a Skinner Box 
People are quite clever 
and so instead 
along with Dr Aaron Blaisdell 
I have developed
a much more elaborate ruse 
Welcome to Victory Vault 
♪
Michael Victory Vault 
is a fake game show we made up
to draw our
unsuspecting subjects
into taking part in
a human Skinner Box 
To accomplish this 
we rented a sound stage
and constructed what appeared
to be a game show set 
but was really our study 
We outfitted the room
with a checkboard floor 
a button that serves
no purpose 
multiple cameras
and a live microphone 
all of which have absolutely no
connection to winning the game 
We also included
an ATM slot on the wall
where instead of food 
dollar bills would be fed
into the room
Meanwhile I would be
playing the role
of the executive producer
of this new game show
testing out the concept
for a television network 
Our first subject is Rebecca 
Yes I know nothing 
I m excited 
Excellent excellent 
Well I ll you some things
that you need to know 
One you will get to keep
all of the money
that you get today 
The object of the game
is to collect as much money
as possible 
 OK laughs 
 Now you will have
ten minutes 
and that s all
I m going to tell you 
 Go OK 
 OK 
 Rebecca OK 
 Michael over loudspeaker 
All right Rebecca begin
in three two one go 
Blaisdell Of course 
right to the button 
but she s not fixated on it 
she s definitely
looking around there 
Rebecca I m trying
if there s like a puzzle 
or what this is about 
Am I supposed to just get out 
No not supposed to get out OK 
Oh OK there s money 
Is that one clue 
Rebecca 
I ve earned one dollar 
 laughs 
See She s earned one dollar 
Earned 
I mean she thinks she
caused it to happen 
Let s see I think
I might be onto something
 with this door maybe 
 Blaisdell 
The second dollar bill
came out really shortly
after she manipulated the door 
That s what Skinner would call
adventitious reinforcement 
She accidentally just
happened to be doing something 
 and now look 
 Hello 
Look it reinforced that
behavior look how strong it s
become 
Now she s doing a lot
with the door 
and this dancing just like
one of Skinner s pigeons 
 Anything 
 See 
For the first two minutes 
Rebecca believed
a specific combination
of the door and the button
were triggering the money 
She had created
a superstitious ritual 
But when her old ritual
ceased to line up with
the reward being delivered 
she started exploring
new actions 
Would you like to keep
sending money 
Is it something with this 
Hello dollar bill 
Michael This change
in Rebecca s behavior
indicates that
she stopped believing
that pressing the button
is associated with
money coming out 
extinction 
 singing 
♪ Keep sending money 
what if I dance ♪
Michael Not it seems
she believes
her new actions
might connect to the reward 
 Five four three 
 Rebecca yelps 
 two one 
 Let s try coming out again 
 zero stop 
 And OK 
I don t think I solved
this mystery 
Michael Rebecca 
You got some money huh 
 I did 
 Come take a seat 
So first of all 
how d it go 
Oh Very confusing 
I wasn t able to
fully figure it out 
but it was something to do
with the white squares
on the floor 
Something to do with
the red button as well 
like a pattern maybe 
Oh Maybe I should have tried
clicking on the button
 times 
 Yes 
 OK you wanna know what
makes the money come out 
Yes It s probably
something really crazy 
 It s just seconds passing 
 Blaissdell Yep 
 It has nothing to do
with what you do 
 Ohh 
You would have gotten
the same amount 
but you could just sat
on the floor and done nothing 
 laughing 
This is actually
a psychological experiment
based on some work done
by B F Skinner 
and we are looking at
the kinds of behaviors
people invent
that they think
controls the money 
 But I think
this was fascinating 
 Blaisdell Yeah 
 And you really do
get to keep the money 
 Yay 
 Rebecca thank you
for your help today 
 Cool Thank you guys 
Rebecca s rituals
seemed to indicate
that she thought performing
for the camera
would work the best 
Her beliefs about TV shows
informed
the kinds of superstitions
she would create 
But will other people
develop the same superstitions 
Or will it depend on the
beliefs and expectations
they already have 
The object of Victory Vault
as you can 
Oh OK Well let me take
these accessories off there
really quickly 
As soon as that door closes 
your ten minutes starts 
I don t get to ask questions 
Not on Victory Vault 
See you in ten minutes 
Where s the cash 
It s like an escape room 
Am I supposed to push this 
Blaisdell Some people
really wanted instructions 
Michael Yeah 
Contestant 
I feel like if I push this 
the time is gonna be up 
Michael Like Rebecca 
all of our subjects
immediately gravitated
to the useless button 
That button is so salient 
Push the button 
Oh shit 
 Michael Blaisdell laugh 
He was a little surprised
at that 
Oh OK I think I get it 
Is it push the button 
Will I push the button 
Am I supposed to
push the button 
 rapping ♪ If you re gon 
push the button then you re
goin with the button ♪
♪ And I m pushin 
on the button ♪
Michael It was clear
that most of the superstitions
began with the button 
but evolved into something else
very quickly 
including this guy 
whose superstitious behavior
was doing absolutely nothing 
Blaisdell 
He s just standing there 
Will he do something 
 chuckling 
Maybe taking the money
is bad 
I know strippers get singles
for dancing 
Blaisdell Is he gonna dance 
I hope he doesn t strip for us 
I can t dance like that 
Maybe I can sweet talk
It s just giving me money
at this point 
I m not doing anything 
He s no fool 
He s not really showing
much superstitious behavior 
Even in Skinner s experiments 
not all the pigeons
showed superstitious behaviors 
Obviously there s a game 
I called it a game show 
But the money s
just piling up
like it s contagious 
Oh look 
Uh Oh 
He really doesn t
want to push it 
Come on 
Press it four times 
out comes the money 
 Press it four times 
 Out comes the money 
 contestant laughing 
She believes that
pressing the button
is necessary is a cause 
And the ritual consists
of a few actions
strung together 
Five four three 
two one stop 
Can I push the button 
 Time is up 
 Damn 
Stay where you are 
We will see you very soon 
I feel like I was
supposed to push the button 
Michael Pigeons don t enter
a Skinner Box
with nearly as many
preconceived notions
as humans do 
Humans come in with a rich
diversity of expectations 
Some think they need
to perform for the camera 
or make the producers laugh 
This guy thought
that the secret was
to just be different 
Hold it Oh I thought 
Take a seat 
 What was that 
 Michael Great work 
What made the money come out 
This is what I finally thought 
It was a test
not to push the button 
and then as I kept saying
a cer a word 
like phrase and button 
it kept coming out 
But I didn t know how
it was supposed to be phrased 
Hit that button 
Hit it a lot 
As if your life
depended on it 
I was thinking 
What would people not do 
 Probably just stand there 
So I was like well 
let s just stand there
and see what happens 
Maybe they ll reward patience
over impulsiveness 
 You started doing exercises 
 Man Yeah 
I don t know if it rewarded you
for just being 
doing crazy things 
Did you learn anything 
That it was dispensing
like a dollar every 
I don t know 
like seconds
or something 
You re right 
You had no control
over when the money
came out 
It s pretty interesting 
I m wondering
 if that s because
of who you are 
 Yep 
 Wh Who are you 
 Blaisdell Elaborate 
That s just like my thought
process I think 
like I m just very observant 
You came up with this great
entering and exiting the room
thing 
Because the money
didn t start coming out
until after I 
I waited I waited I waited 
and nothing came out
until after I left
and came back in 
You shoulda just
left me in there
to get more money 
You made a sistah
work hard for her money 
Victory Vault 
a k a human
Skinner Box experiment 
What are your thoughts 
We re really finding
that humans are susceptible
to superstitious
beliefs or behaviors 
I totally agree 
Except there were some people
who were able to guess
with some degree of confidence
that they didn t have control 
Some people were probably
just skeptical from the
get go 
 And that s just
their personality 
Yeah the beliefs
that people brought
into that room
really affected
what beliefs or lack thereof 
 they created in the room
once the game started 
 Yeah 
We re belief machines 
We re pattern seekers 
And there s even
a belief that in psychology
and in anthropology
that may be the way
a lot of rituals got started 
by accidental reinforcement 
And then it becomes
codified into a religion
or a cultural practice 
Our human sized Skinner Box
showed that when confronted
with uncertainty 
people often behaved
superstitiously 
under the belief
that they do have control 
But of course 
nothing anyone did
in that box
would make the money
come out any faster 
So those superstitions
were lies 
But sometimes
if a lie is believed in enough 
it can literally become true 
like a placebo 
Now I ve been watching
a lot of horror movies lately 
and they gave me an idea 
If I m able to find just
the right preexisting beliefs
to wrap around a placebo 
could I literally
make people believe
that I am possessing them
with a spirit 
a sham reverse exorcism 
Exorcisms are not some
Hollywood fabrication 
and they didn t only happen
hundreds of years ago 
In fact 
in the United States alone 
there are currently
 priests
endorsed by the Vatican s
International Association
of Exorcists 
up from just a decade ago 
But what s a reverse exorcism 
It s something I made up
where instead of removing
a spirit from someone 
you put one in them 
I want to do that because
I don t think it s ethical
to tell someone
they re possessed by a demon 
But I ll need some help 
and I know just who to ask 
Dr Veissiére thank you 
I had a blast last season 
I think that the work we did
and the things you showed me
related to our
power of suggestion work
together on placebos
was so powerful 
Well Michael 
it s a real pleasure 
I m honored
to be here again 
It also is why you re
the person I thought of
for what I want to do next 
Building on the work
we did last season 
I want to explore belief
and what I can
and cannot control 
I want to perform an accessory 
assisted reverse exorcism 
 Reverse exorcism
because I m not gonna tell you
that you have a demon in you
or something in you
that I m gonna remove 
you re fine 
What I can do is make you feel
like you re losing control 
You would like to
experimentally induce
a spirit possession experience 
 I like that 
let s talk details here 
Are there things we can do
to increase the effectiveness
of our reverse exorcism ritual 
Yeah I m thinking
we could probably use
some tricks from hypnosis 
If we went them
to have experiences 
we need to suggest
those experiences
to them specifically 
We would be using a lot of props
from both religion and science
to get people s
critical minds
to relax 
and then we will throw in
some suggestions 
So we ve got
religious iconography 
and we ve got the paraphernalia
of medical science 
Let s do this 
Michael Almost everyone feels
a certain way
in the presence
of medical equipment 
and even though not everyone
observes the same religion 
Swiss psychologist Carl Jung
posited that a person s
belief in a religious symbol
wasn t necessary for it
to exert an influence on them 
Consciously 
they may say it doesn t 
but unconsciously it will 
With Dr Veissiére onboard 
I had Mind Field s
art department
mock up our lab
with plenty of scientific
and religious iconography 
Michael With our lab
dressed to Veissiére s specs 
everything is in place
for our reverse exorcism 
Our five test subjects 
pre screened and vetted
by a psychologist 
arrived at the facility
thinking that they were
going to take part
in a broad study on
the science of religion 
Immediately 
we exposed them to things
that would convince them
of the seriousness
of what they
were about to do 
such as filling out
extensive paperwork 
 woman making announcement 
And an extended period of time
in the waiting room
to increase anticipation
and tension 
We even used a fake participant
to talk up
his amazing experience
in earshot of
the real subjects 
 Woman Hi 
 How was it 
 That was crazy 
 That was something else 
And to really sell
the illusion 
we used multiple actors 
like a fake receptionist 
a nurse to check
the patient s vitals 
and a pretend priest
to add credibility
to the religious angle 
Dr Veissiére played the role
of a scientist
fascinated by the power
of the ritual 
This should influence
our participants 
because how could this all
not be real
if a guy in a white lab coat
is taking it so seriously 
So we are just about
ready to begin 
Now I m watching hidden
cameras that we have
in the exam room
adjacent to us 
Let s see what sorts of
altered states of consciousness
we can create today 
Now this is Jeremiah 
and Jeremiah s been waiting
for about an hour 
Actor Nurse 
So I m gonna be
placing this on your head 
It s called an EEG cap 
it just measures
your brain activity 
This is a really important part
of selling
the scientific realness
of what we re doing 
Jeremiah 
very pleased to meet you 
Thank you so much for coming 
Thank you so much again
for your patience 
I think it s really important
for Veissiére to talk about
how what s about to happen
is special 
it s not a normal ritual 
In fact it s not a ritual
that any lay people really
know about yet 
So the name of the study 
it s a bit of a mouthful 
so we re looking at
neural correlates
and physiologic markers
of ritually induced
mystical experiences 
I have run this experiment
about times 
and some people enter
some kind of encounter with
what they may call
a divine presence 
 Jeremiah How s it goin 
 Michael Here comes
the priest 
 I m Jeremiah Nice to meet
you sir 
 Father Callahan 
Father Callahan 
the Stephen King character 
OK we might
have to change that 
Actor Priest Jeremiah 
what I d like you to do 
is relax and I d like you
just to casually stare
at the crucifix 
in the center 
Michael We had our priest 
guide Jeremiah
through a holy ritual
which we told him
was a thousand years old 
But in actuality 
Dr Veissiére wrote it himself
just before the demonstration 
Actor Priest 
And you may feel a tendency
that you want to
let your hands raise
towards the sky
as your body falls away 
Michael Getting someone
to literally act possessed
is definitely a difficult test
of the placebo effect 
so I m not exactly sure
what kind of results
we can expect 
However I m at least hoping
that we learn from this
how to better tap into
the power of people s beliefs 
Actor Priest Whatever
the spirit needs to speak 
it will speak 
So now as you keep relaxing 
as the spirit prepares 
Jeremiah sat very still
during the whole ritual 
but we were curious
about what he experienced 
So what
did that feel like 
Jeremiah 
It was weird 
but I could feel like
the presence 
it s a little graphic 
if some like 
cut my head off 
 I didn t feel anything below 
Michael People don t normally
have feelings
of decapitation and numbness 
so either we ve stumbled upon
a way to summon a spirit 
or our belief manipulation
So we ve been working together
on this project 
and I was observing you
from the other room 
And there are two
really powerful
kinds of symbols in the room 
Which one had the biggest
kind of visceral effect on you 
I guess it was kind of
a balance because like 
OK it s religious 
and the nurse comin in 
science it kinda
goes back and forth 
so I want to say even 
Well more has been going on
than what you know
at this moment 
Joe Father Callahan 
was not a priest 
 He s an actor 
and everything that he read
was written by Dr Veissiére 
We re looking at how
a thing that has no
known causal link
to any particular reaction
or behavior or feeling
can nonetheless
induce a feeling 
Jeremiah s experience
was pretty curious 
and since
nothing too serious happened 
his head didn t spin around 
we felt more comfortable
pushing things a bit further 
I m the lead
behavioral scientist
in charge of the experiment 
this is my colleague
Dr Stevens 
Michael First I interacted
with the participants
before the ritual 
to build up their expectation
of something happening 
like possession 
So today you will be
listening to a reverse exorcism 
 I m already possessed 
I m already possessed 
Michael We also decided
to dim the lights
to decrease their inhibitions
and increase the atmosphere 
Michael I think it s gonna be
great for our participants
and for the whole mood 
I mean it s spooky stuff 
Before you can fully
experience the divine 
I ll simply just invite you
to kind of relax 
Michael And we decided
to have Dr Veissiére
lead the ritual
instead of our priest 
so that he could use
his training
in behavioral psychology
to harness
The priest continued to serve
as an important religious
anchor point
for the subject to focus on 
Veissiére All of your
actions and reactions
gradually fade and disappear
as your body is now
approaching the divine 
You may notice 
your fingers tingling a little 
You may feel your mouth 
needing to tweak a little 
Her mouth is opening 
slowly 
As the divine
tries to speak through you 
filling your mouth perhaps 
gently ever so slowly 
You are now awake 
When the ritual ended 
each of our participants
had something very interesting
to report 
He did definitely
have an aura around him 
the Father 
Woman 
I could feel just
this everlasting joy
and peace of God
just covering me 
a glowing figure man 
and then the cross
was like right in front of me 
We ve got medical science
and we ve got ancient
religious symbols 
And what we re
specifically looking at
is how the accessories
play into your expectations 
I liked the visual part 
I didn t like the audio part 
 Interesting 
 I wasn t connecting with it 
Woman I ve always thought
that the kind of traditional 
ritualistic parts of church 
they just never appealed to me 
I think it was more the symbols
that was more comforting 
because that s just
the way I was raised 
One of the most intriguing
was our final subject Miriam 
What was it like for you 
Um I went to another place 
OK OK 
I immediately felt my mother s 
her spirit with me 
she was telling me 
 to come towards her 
And when I got close to her 
she was comforting me 
 Um and I heard an angel say 
I m here with you 
I will never leave you 
And I continued to see wings 
 Wings Interesting 
Michael Miriam s experience
seemed to have
a profound effect on her 
but I wanted to hear more about
what exactly happened to her 
When you say
that you saw things 
describe for me
what that was 
Was it like a daydream 
or was it more like um 
really there 
It was extremely vivid 
Um I could feel the wind
when it started going across 
I could vividly see my mother
standing there smiling at me 
 She looked beautiful 
Michael The fact that Miriam
had an out of body experience
and saw her deceased mother 
was almost puzzling 
because everything we did
in the room was a lie 
The priest was not real 
the ritual was not
a thousand years old 
the nurse was an actress 
but yet Miriam s experience
and those of the other
participants were real 
The thing that surprised me
the most today
was how personal
every single moment was 
I think because of a combination
of the powerful imagery 
both religious and scientific 
it becomes the most powerful
experience they ve had 
Even if you re
a very staunch atheist 
a cross and a lectionary 
these things 
they re pregnant with meaning 
We seem to have found
that by using those cues 
people were able to tune in
very very deeply 
and to relinquish
their sense of self control 
Here s a question 
What s the difference
between what we did today
and what an actual priest
can do 
That s a really
controversial question 
Um I think the difference
is that unlike the priest 
we understand the mechanisms
through a more psychological
route 
whereas many priests
may themselves be convinced
that they are facilitating
communication with the divine 
And perhaps they are 
The results can be the same 
regardless of the intentions
of the facilitators 
There s no way to prove
whether or not
God worked in this room today 
I guess ultimately 
with the tools of science 
no there isn t 
These are still
some really difficult
philosophical questions 
So we have demonstrated that
our brains are belief making
machines 
Rather than accepting confusion
and uncertainty 
we create superstitions
and beliefs
that make us feel like
we have control over our lives 
In fact to not form
a superstition
or belief or guess
about the world around us
is to be powerless 
even when superstitions
are unconnected to reality 
That doesn t mean
they can t be powerful 
Our reverse exorcism ritual
and its practitioners
were all placebos 
But the mere existence
of our subjects beliefs in them
made them real
and transformative 
So does that make us all fools 
I don t know 
but I don t believe so 
And as always 
﻿Moral psychology isn t always
an easy thing to study 
just using a survey
to ask people
what they think is moral
doesn t always reveal what they
would do in real life 
An experiment that actually
puts people
in what feels like
a real scenario
may get more realistic results 
but researchers must always
balance the benefits
of what we could learn
with the safety and well being
of the people they study 
Secondly what we learn from
moral psychology experiments
doesn t always make humans
look good 
For example today we re going
to look at moral licensing 
the theory that when you do
something good 
you subconsciously feel
you ve earned a license
to then do something bad 
I ve been working
with Dr Kyle Stanford 
from the Department of Logic
and Philosophy of Science
of California Irvine 
on a way to observe
moral licensing in the wild 
So I want to see moral licensing
in effect 
I want to see people
who have been led to believe 
through their own actions 
that they re good 
Use that feeling
to do bad 
The thing to keep in mind 
it s like people
are keeping tabs 
and they give themselves credit
for the moral 
the good thing they did 
But none of that is happening
consciously right 
So we shouldn t imagine
that a person who s engaged
in moral licensing is asking
themselves in their head 
Right pulling out
their scorecard 
 what should I be 
Does it make me a good person 
But it is going on 
and they don t experience it 
 They don t know that it s
happening 
I think we re going to learn
a lot today 
 I say we go get started 
 Let s do it 
Let s do it 
 Michael So here s how
the moral licensing test
we designed is going to work 
First we re going to take
this beautiful park
and for the purposes
of science 
throw trash everywhere 
Next we ve hired
some unsuspecting actors
who think they re going to film
a public service announcement
about the park 
 Hey Jake Hey man 
 Hi 
Once they ve arrived 
it will be obvious
that the trash is a problem 
We just need to clean up this
little alleyway right here 
Will they do a good deed
and earn some moral credit
by volunteering to help
pick up the trash or not 
And to make everything
feel more real 
we did have them film
our fake PSA 
Forget the concrete
and the heat 
Relax in over
 square feet 
Of outdoor space
that can t be beat 
Right outside your door 
Right outside
your door 
After shooting the PSA 
each participant will be asked
to wait in a separate area
for some final paperwork 
There our confederate Cameron 
who appears to be homeless 
will ask them for money 
Meanwhile Dr Stanford and I
will be watching
behind the scenes to observe
how our subjects react 
So will our participants
keep their subconscious
moral scorecards balanced
by giving money
when they didn t clean 
or feeling like they don t need
to give money if they did 
 Hey 
 Makaylo 
Makaylo nice to meet you 
First up in our demo
was Makaylo 
We used our actual
Mind Field crew
as the crew of the fake PSA
who are overwhelmed
with the task
of cleaning up
all the trash 
We normally sort of
never ask this but 
we ve got like all this stuff
that we re trying to clean up 
I m going to grab some gloves 
I was wondering 
would you help me 
 I m sorry 
 Let s do it Let s do it 
All three of us
can triple team it 
 and we can get this thing
going 
Yeah this is just
what we wanted to do today 
It looks like someone
had a good time though 
so picking up the trash 
How do you think
that s currently sitting
with our actor 
He s thinking of himself as
having done a good deed
that he didn t need to do 
that he didn t have to do 
Right And so the moral credit
is high 
to shoot our PSA 
Take it away 
Relax in 
square feet 
That was great All right man 
 Hey thanks so much 
 Cool No problem man 
We compensated our participants
for the PSA in small bills
so they would have plenty
to give the homeless man 
should they choose to do so 
 Here s 
 Thank you thank you 
Then we asked them to wait
in a nearby tent
for their final paperwork 
Will Makaylo s good deed
be enough moral credit
for him to pass on
helping the homeless guy 
All right Cameron 
this is Michael 
You can go ahead 
What s up 
 What s up 
Are you with this 
Yeah I m just waiting
for someone to help me out here 
Could you help me out
with like a dollar or two 
Just I can go
to the vending machine 
Sorry my man I ain t
got nothing but bills on me
Oh I got nothing
but bills 
 You sure 
 Yeah man 
All right well 
We re going to go talk to him 
Hey Makaylo 
 Hey 
 Thanks for waiting 
 I m Michael Nice to meet you 
 No problem Makaylo 
 This is Kyle 
Nice to meet you 
Makaylo 
We really appreciate
your help today 
 I just saw Did a guy come by 
What did he ask 
 For a dollar bill 
 Michael Oh for a dollar
bill 
Did you give him money 
 No 
 What d you tell him 
I just told him
I didn t have anything 
So I m going to debrief you
on what we re doing here today 
We re doing a psychological
exploratory experiment
on what s called
moral licensing 
We re looking at the correlation
between people
who do volunteer to help
pick up the trash 
and how generous you are later
to a homeless person
who walks by 
Now you just exhibited
the exact pattern
of moral licensing right 
In that you had already
done a good deed 
So I was good for the day 
Did we just see
moral licensing in effect 
Perhaps 
Let s see what
our other subjects do 
Here let me just have you
hang out here 
Is there anybody
that can help us clean up this 
 I m going to go look around 
 All right 
Okay so this is Alex 
And Alex is just messing
with his stuff 
 Kyle 
He s either not really noticing 
or pretending not to notice 
But all of that is just fine 
The question is
what he then goes on to do 
 Michael So Alex didn t help
pick up trash 
Will his guilt put him
at a moral deficit 
and therefore motivate him to
give money to the homeless man 
Can you spare some money 
Maybe help me out 
 You want a buck 
 A buck Yeah 
Can I give you a buck 
Is that cool 
 Cameron 
That s more than cool man 
I just got paid to be here 
 Really 
Helping to shoot a PSA yeah 
Where do I sign up 
 All right take care 
Very interesting 
I do wonder if he felt
a little bit of guilt 
We got it in the opposite
direction 
 which was going to be
the hard thing to do 
I m very happy about this 
Next we have Jake 
So I m on set doing a PSA shoot 
Hey he s doing a vlog 
And I get here 
and it appears
that someone had a 
what could only be described
as a trash party 
I mean they just threw trash
literally everywhere 
all over where they want
to shoot 
So I m going to go help them
pick up some of the trash 
First I m going to make sure
that I document
that I m a helper 
I would also like to point out 
though that he has not helped 
 Kyle Right 
 He s gone back into the tent 
And I wonder when it comes
to moral licensing 
does this play an effect 
I can check the box 
Not only am I good 
but the world knows I m good 
Now this is something
we haven t seen before 
I love this 
I love that he got credit
for helping 
 but didn t 
What s interesting
but hard to know
is how that ll look to him 
whether he ll see himself
as having done a good deed 
or seeing himself as kind of
skated on the obligation 
because he didn t
really help 
Hey do you think
you could spare some money 
maybe help me out 
Here man 
Here s a dollar 
Go for it 
All right you re a good man 
We were really curious as we
were watching this all unfold 
because you agreed to help 
and then you recorded a video
about how you were
going to help 
but by the time all that
was over 
you didn t need to help 
It was all cleaned up 
 So we were wondering 
did you feel like
you had helped or not 
No I didn t have time to 
And you didn t feel guilty 
Like ooh I kind of like
got out of helping 
No I didn t feel bad
about that 
I would have definitely
picked up trash 
Erin s likely to be thinking
that she s doing a good deed 
Could you maybe help me out 
give me some money 
I m sorry I don t have
anything on me here 
 No 
 They won t let me 
 Oh 
 That was great 
 Yes we have a couple
good illustrations
in both directions 
 Michael We seemed to have
witnessed moral licensing
at play in several cases 
But of course as with
any demonstration like this 
our results weren t always
cut and dry 
I m going to go try
to clean this up myself 
and then 
Gotcha Yeah yeah 
Some of the participants
both didn t help clean
and declined to give
our homeless man money 
Could you maybe
spare some change 
I just want to go
However they did find
other ways to help hiim
that could qualify
as a good deed 
They have snacks maybe 
I m going
to take a pop 
Do you want a soda
or something 
Yeah that d be 
Do you maybe have a little
money as well 
 I don t sorry But 
 which one
do you want 
So what was going
through your mind
when you made the decision
not to give
some of the cash
that we know you had
to the man who was asking 
You know there s just like
a whole bunch of stereotypes
about homeless people 
And you don t know
what you re getting into 
And we had a couple subjects
who both volunteered to clean
and gave money 
Do you need any
assistance 
If you wouldn t mind 
that d be really helpful 
Oh he s offering to help Oh 
 Do you need any help 
 Oh would you mind 
 Kyle Oh she just offered 
She offered 
 Michael She s volunteered 
These were the only two
participants
who did good deeds
at both opportunities 
 man Thank you so much for the
help 
 Diana Of course 
 Do you maybe have some spare
change 
 Here you go 
 Thanks a lot 
 Best of luck 
 Here you go Hope it helps 
 Thank you so much 
You re welcome 
All right let s go talk to her 
Another good 
good person 
What motivated you
to give the man money 
I actually tend to give people
money often 
I don t know if that s
the best thing 
So two people both cleaned
and donated money 
But everyone else either
cleaned and didn t give 
or didn t clean 
but gave in some form 
What do you think
about how everything went 
Well it was really interesting 
I would like to do it with many
more people 
But I think we saw
the phenomenon right 
We saw the thing happen 
Something we weren t expecting 
actually 
is sort of the gap between
what people did
and what they said
about why they did it 
 Right And that s something 
I mean social psychology
generally has learned
to be very suspicious
of people s rationales
or justifications
for their own behavior 
But these actually fit
kind of nicely 
You could see people straining
to defend themselves
if they didn t do a good deed
that was open to them 
Right And then a lot of people
who did good deeds had the 
Well of course that s what
anyone would do attitude 
 Right 
 Michael Yeah 
I believe our study
successfully created
the conditions
for moral licensing
to emerge 
It was a great first step
towards taking
this kind of study
out of the lab
and into the real world 
But of course many people
already have a philosophy
about giving to the homeless
that might be stronger
than the impact
of a good deed they do 
So we re not done yet 
Now here s what I want
to do next okay 
We learned a lot
of lessons today 
and I think one of them is that
when the scenarios
you put people in
are scenarios they may have
experienced before 
that can affect
the results 
If someone did or did not
give money to a homeless person 
they can easily
explain it away as 
Well I never do 
or I always do 
I want to find a scenario
that we don t find ourselves
in very often 
that we haven t created
a philosophy
or identity about ourselves
around 
For instance 
allowing someone else
for something that you did 
Because that seems
like a scenario
where all of us would say
we would never let that happen 
But if we build up significant
moral license in that person 
will they actually
do something
that none of us would ever want
to admit that we would do 
Are you down to plan
something else 
I am down indeed 
All right let s do it 
 Michael Kyle and I developed
a different sort of test
to really try and pinpoint
moral licensing
by putting our participants
in a situation
they d likely never
been in before 
and thus had no preconceived
assumptions about 
A test that might make people
behave in a way
that could surprise
even themselves 
Welcome everybody 
Thank you for coming today 
what we re doing
is we re going to see if we can
get people to do something
that almost all of us
would never admit
we re capable of doing 
to allow a child
for a crime
they committed 
And we re going to do that
by using moral licensing 
Early on in the demonstration
or experiment 
they re going to have
an opportunity to donate money 
To really up the value
of their moral action 
we will tell the participants
that for every dollar they give
of the money
they ve made today 
 times that amount will be
given to children s hospitals 
So if they donate
just a dollar today 
they ll feel like
they gave 
We re giving them a chance there
to do something morally good
that will hopefully
make them feel
like they don t have
to step up
and keep this innocent child
from taking the fall
for their crimes later on 
They just think they re coming
to test out
really cool VR equipment
at the YouTube Space
in Los Angeles 
Our participants will think
that they re here to focus test
a new kind of VR technology 
But what they don t know
is that everyone else
is a hired actor 
including the child Noah 
Participants will be told
that security
is of the utmost concern 
and not to let anyone
into the room 
Just be sure not to let
anybody in 
because the doors 
you need a key card 
But while waiting 
someone will knock
on the door 
 knock 
If they break protocol
and open the door 
the man they let in will steal
some of the VR equipment 
You guys have a good day 
Even though the participant
let the thief in 
Noah will volunteer
that he did 
and be blamed for what
the participant knows
they were responsible for 
 And Noah you let him in 
Yeah I let someone in 
 Michael Putting participants
into difficult moral scenarios
needs to be done carefully 
so we have a psychiatrist
on call 
Now with all the details
in place it s time to begin 
All right Noah 
we are starting 
Head on in 
Go ahead and grab a seat 
is Kimberly 
Kimberly gave of her
earnings from the study 
which means she thinks
that she s donated 
Just be sure that if you guys
need to go to the bathroom
or anything like that 
be sure to let someone know 
Because no one
without a key card
 should be coming back in 
 Okay Gotcha 
you can cue your mom to leave 
 mother Just stay there 
 Noah Okay 
To get rid of any eyewitnesses 
Noah s mom left the room
to go get a coffee 
 door closes 
 Have you done this 
 No I m excited 
 Oh nice 
 Have you 
 both chuckle 
 knock on door 
Oh there s the knocking 
So our thief is trying
to get in 
The question is 
will Kimberly let him in 
 knocking persists 
Is somebody knocking 
I love those suspicious eyes 
 man Thank you so much 
 Oh yeah you re welcome 
 Oh thank you 
you re welcome 
You guys having
a good day 
You guys have
a good day 
All right I think we are
finally ready for you 
Okay I ll have you 
do you guys know
if there was anybody
who wasn t supposed
to be in here 
stay right here 
Okey dokey 
 door closes 
What happened 
Kimberly didn t speak up 
We ll get to see
the full escalation 
Yeah I was gone for maybe 
like three minutes 
one of the sets is gone 
I mean 
 the amount of technology 
The protocols
that are kept in there 
You just opened the door
and let someone in 
Mm mm 
Oh my gosh 
My heart rate s going 
I didn t know so 
I think Kimberly s really
nervous to say anything 
She hasn t decided at this point
that she s going to let him
take the blame 
But she s seeing
how it plays out 
 Michael To further heighten
the situation 
and to prolong
the opportunity
for Kimberly to come clean 
we sent in security 
You re All right just have
the rest of the employees
stay out of the hallway give
the officers room to come in 
Okay we have to keep
things safe 
because just in case there s
something else going on here 
Can you tell me
what you saw 
Is there something
that you saw 
or that you noticed
that was 
I literally just came in like 
five minutes ago 
and there was just dudes
coming in and out 
 So 
The guy that he s describing 
he was coming in and out 
There was like a couple guys
coming in and out so 
 Noah But there were tons of
guys coming in and out 
All right I m going to have
Calvin take the kid away 
Okay sorry but 
Mom you and the son are going
to need to come with me okay 
Yeah still have them
come in 
 Michael Kimberly was given
many chances to tell the truth 
but she said nothing 
letting poor Noah
 mother 
Why 
One little thing
to follow 
 Noah 
Sorry 
Can I go 
Like everybody left 
I m not going to be here
by myself 
We got to get in there 
Okay let s go Kyle 
 Are you Kimberly 
 I am Yeah 
I m gonna debrief you on what s
been happening here today 
Okay 
There is no VR experience 
I m Michael Stevens I m the
host of a psychology program 
And this is Kyle Stanford 
He works at UC Irvine 
 in Philosophy and Logic 
 Yes Of course 
Now you gave a donation today 
How d you feel
about that 
I was like 
let me help out 
When the child actor
took responsibility
for letting a person in 
were you at all
conflicted
about the fact
that he was taking
full responsibility
for everything 
I was literally like 
just frozen 
I was just frozen 
And then I was kind of like 
I feel so uncomfortable
I like just kind of let him
say whatever he wanted 
And I assume like if somebody
actually took anything 
they d be like hey you re
the one that let the guy in 
In Kimberly s case 
she may have been displaying
Kimberly donated 
and that might have given her
the moral credit
to then not accept blame 
If she s not being insincere 
she s not lying 
 She s asking herself like 
 and convincing herself 
she s utterly typical 
we all do that 
What subjects are most likely
doing is confabulating
in a way to defend whatever
behavior they engage in 
especially if they decided
to let Noah take the fall 
What I love is that
confabulation 
Some participants gave
no donation 
 and subsequently followed
the order not to open the door 
Guys please 
My hands are full 
I got to get this in there 
My boss told me to 
Please guys 
This is Zeus 
He chose to donate 
which means he feels like
he s responsible
for a donation 
Hey guys 
Did you 
was there anyone in here
who didn t have
one of these key cards 
Yes Sorry I let someone in 
Okay I 
 Wait wait wait 
 I will be right back 
Miss that was me 
Don t take the blame for me 
It was me 
I thought he worked here 
Okay um 
just stay right here guys 
I will be right back 
Even though Zeus donated money 
he still did what many of us
would consider the right thing 
he confessed 
Situations like this
can be difficult 
We don t always like
what we learn about ourselves 
one of the participants
who donated
the largest amount
allowed Noah to be removed
by security
and asked to not be included
in this episode 
Our last participant
was Michael 
who did not donate 
Hey Hello 
I got a box out here man 
I can t 
hello 
Thank you man 
I m amazed that no one has asked
the guy for a badge 
Was there someone
in here 
This guy just came in 
 He was banging on the door 
Came in picked something up 
and then he walked out 
 Um 
 I was drawing 
 did he have a badge 
 I don t know 
 I let him in so 
I let him in 
I don t know what happened 
He was banging
on the door 
Michael initially confessed 
his behavior in line
with moral licensing 
But Noah spoke up 
giving Michael an out 
Will Michael
stick to the truth 
 Oh here we go 
He let the guy in 
Son can you tell me
what happened 
Yeah a guy was knocking
on the door and he said 
Can I please come in 
Something about his boss 
And then 
 security guard 
You said 
Guy was banging on the door 
said his boss 
Opened the door for him 
He comes in here 
he takes something 
and then he walks out 
And Noah you let him in 
 security guard Okay you
opened the door and let him in 
What must be racing through
Michael s head right now 
 Why is this kid 
 It s very hard
to imagine 
This is a very strange
situation 
 Michael Obviously 
 a regular person to be in 
I think you re just thinking 
Why is this kid
saying he did it 
Trying to figure it out Yeah 
I think 
at this point 
you and your mom are going
to need to come with me 
because we re going to need
to talk to the police 
because he opened
the door 
and he was not supposed
to open the door 
 and he opened up the door 
 If you d just listen 
I tell you 
just listen 
 I promise we re right 
 Mom come with me 
Promise 
Just keep your hands to yourself
and do what I ask you to do 
God 
We should go in 
What made it difficult
to come forward
and admit that you were the one
who opened the door 
I felt uncomfortable
that something was stolen one 
Two that this kid was going
to take the blame 
I mean I needed to step up
and be accountable
if I opened the door 
But it was just didn t quite
know what was going on
in that scenario there 
Michael s behavior shows us
just how complicated
moral reasoning is 
That even when we want
to do the right thing 
it doesn t take much
for us to step back
and abandon that sense
of morality if and when 
we are given an out 
So Kyle 
I was pretty surprised
by how far
so many people were willing
to let the wrong blame game go 
Viewers may well
be sitting there
judging the people who didn t
jump up to take responsibility 
But I think the kind of evidence
we re gathering
shows that it s much more
possible than you think
to get regular people
to do things
that they immediately
feel regretful about 
Another kind of lesson
I think we get here
is to remind ourselves
how sensitive all of us are
to features of the situation 
even if we feel
in our heart of hearts
 like there s no way we could
ever have wound up doing it 
That is probably
the number one lesson 
and I m so grateful to the
participants we had here today
who helped us illustrate that 
because without
the illustrations 
it s just a word
in a textbook 
We are all capable
of doing things
we d never expect ourselves
to do 
And the choices
that you make
can have less to do
with how good or bad
you are as a person 
and more to do with
how you ve acted recently 
Now that might
sound unfortunate 
but we are
imperfect creatures 
And that s nothing
to be ashamed of 
because we are also curious 
And the more we learn
about why and how
we make the moral choices
that we do 
the better we ll be able
to tackle
difficult questions
﻿One of the most infamous
psychological studies
ever conducted
was the Stanford Prison
Experiment 
It s mentioned in almost every
intro to psychology textbook 
They tend to focus on
how unethical it was 
and are less critical
of its supposed conclusion 
August th 
Palo Alto California 
Twelve young men are rounded
up from their homes by police 
placed under arrest 
and brought to
a makeshift prison
in the basement
of Stanford University 
It all begins as a study on
the psychology of prison life 
led by Stanford psychology
professor Dr Philip Zimbardo 
 volunteers 
 guards
and prisoners 
 have agreed to spend
the next two weeks
recreating life
in a correctional facility 
 guard 
The prisoners are booked
and stripped nude 
They re no longer
individuals 
forced to wear smocks 
stocking caps and shackles 
Identified only by
their prisoner numbers 
The guards quickly adapt
to their new profession 
Given anonymity by
their mirrored sunglasses 
some of them start to control
the meager food rations 
restrict prisoners 
bathroom use 
And as tensions rise 
so do their cruel methods 
Within just six days
of the planned two week study 
conditions are so bad
that the entire operation
is shut down 
Goddamn it 
The study makes international
headlines 
Zimbardo s fame skyrockets 
and his conclusions are taught
to students worldwide 
used as a defense
in criminal trials
and are even submitted
to Congress
to explain the abuses
inflicted at Abu Ghraib 
The study brings up
a question
just as important then
as it is today 
is evil caused
by the environment 
or the personalities in it 
Zimbardo s shocking conclusion
is that when people
feel anonymous
and have power over
depersonalized others 
they can easily become evil 
And it occurs more often
than we d like to admit 
But while it s true that people
were mean to each other
during the Stanford
Prison Experiment 
what if what truly caused
that behavior
wasn t what we ve always
been told 
The Stanford Prison Experiment
has always had
its controversies 
But a wave of recent
revelations
have pushed it back
into the spotlight
 years later 
Today I m going to speak
with journalist Ben Blum 
whose recent writings
have brought criticism
of the experiment
to a larger audience
than ever before 
How did you get involved in
the Stanford Prison Experiment
in the first place 
Well my involvement
was quite personal 
Like everyone 
I had kind of absorbed
the basic lesson
through the cultural ether 
And then my cousin Alex
was arrested for bank robbery 
This was a team of mostly
military guys with AK s 
Alex was the driver 
He was a year old
U S Army Ranger 
And it was a superior of his
on the Rangers
that organized and led
the bank robbery 
Alex thought the whole thing
was a training exercise 
He was just so brainwashed
in this intense Ranger training
that when a superior proposed
this bank robbery 
he took it as just one more kind
of tactical thought experiment 
Then Dr Philip Zimbardo
participated
in his legal defense 
Zimbardo submits a letter
to the court 
advocating leniency
in sentencing on the grounds
that Alex my cousin 
had been so transformed
by the social environment
of the Ranger battalion
that he participated
in the bank robbery
without exercising
his own free will 
Well how did that affect
Alex s sentencing 
He received an extraordinarily
lenient sentence of months 
So Zimbardo was a family hero 
But over time Alex 
finally he did admit to me 
you know what I knew this was
a bank robbery by the end 
and I just didn t have the moral
courage to back out 
Alex myself and our
whole family
came to view
the Zimbardo argument
as a way to shirk personal
culpability 
and to put all the blame
on the situation 
So you start looking
at the Stanford Prison
Experiment in particular 
You reached out to Dr Zimbardo
himself 
as well as some of those
who participated 
What did you learn 
I learned 
to my deep surprise 
that quite a number
of the participants
had stories of their experience
that completely contradicted
the official narrative 
Which is look 
these regular people 
good people 
came together 
and because of the situation 
became evil 
 Ben 
Zimbardo has claimed
that the guards
were put in the situation 
and then the kind of hidden
wellspring of sadism
that apparently lies
in all of us
unfolded organically 
 Zimbardo 
There was an orientation meeting
for the guards 
They had been told
quite explicitly
to oppress the prisoners 
That falls under the heading
of what psychologists call
demand characteristics 
Experimental subjects
tend to be motivated
to give experimenters
what they want 
Demand characteristics occur
whenever participants
being studied
act differently
than they normally would
because they ve guessed
what hypothesis is being tested
and feel that a certain kind
of behavior is being demanded 
There was a recording
of explicitly correcting a guard
who wasn t being tough enough 
So a conclusion
you could make
from the Stanford
Prison Experiment
is that when you tell people
to be cruel 
they ll do it if you tell them
it s for a greater good 
like science 
 Who would have thought 
I think the study stands still
as a fascinating spur
to further more careful research
as a demonstration that should
make anyone curious
as to how such extreme behavior
could arise
in such a short time 
The experiment could still
be useful 
but it might need to be
reinterpreted 
Its data might lead
to different conclusions
than the one that we ve been
telling for so many decades 
The flaws in the experiment
that Ben and other critics
bring up
call into question large
portions of the narrative
surrounding the study 
So I want to hear from someone
who was actually there 
Dave Eshelman the study s
most infamous guard 
agreed to tell me
his side of the story 
It s really an honor
to meet you 
You re a living walking piece
of psychology history 
I m never recognized in the
street or anything like that 
although I still get
some hate mail 
 Are you serious 
 Yeah absolutely 
Well what do you say to them
when they react that way 
I say well there s probably
a lot about that
that didn t happen quite the way
it s been portrayed 
Well Dave 
before we go too far 
I d like to watch the footage
we have here
so we can kind of talk about
what we see 
 Dave 
That s me there by the way 
 Michael Look at that look 
 Dave Mm hmm 
So how did you get involved with
a Stanford Prison Experiment 
My father was a professor
at Stanford 
and I was home for summer 
looking for a summer job 
So I m looking
through the want ads 
 a day 
in that wasn t bad 
The way it was introduced
to the guards 
the whole concept
of this experiment 
we were never led to believe
that we were part
of the experiment 
We were led to believe
that our job
was to get results
from the prisoners 
that they were the ones
the researchers
are really studying 
The researchers
were behind the wall 
And we all knew
they were filming 
And we can often hear
commenting on the action
from the other side of the wall 
You know like 
Oh gosh did you see that 
Here Make sure you get
a close up of that 
Okay So if they want to show
that prison is a bad experience 
I m going to make it bad 
But how did you feel
doing stuff like that 
Didn t you feel bad 
I don t know if this
is a revelation to you 
but year old boys are not
the most sensitive creatures 
 Sure 
 My agenda was to be
the worst guard
I could possibly be 
 And it s pretty serious 
This is my favorite part
of all the footage we have
 from the experiment 
It s you and a prisoner
confronting each other
after the experiment 
I remember the guy saying 
I hate you man 
 I hate you 
Each day I said well 
what can we do to ramp up
what we did yesterday 
How can we build on that 
Why did you want
to ramp things up 
Two reasons I think 
One was because
I really believed
I was helping the researchers
with some better understanding
of human behavior 
it was personally
interesting to me 
You know I cannot say that I
did not enjoy what I was doing 
Maybe you know 
having so much power
over these poor 
defenseless prisoners 
you know maybe you kind of
get off on that a little bit 
You weren t entirely following
a script from a director 
But you also felt like
Zimbardo wanted something
from you 
 And you gave that to him 
I believe I did 
I think I decided
I was going to do a better job
than anybody there
of delivering
what he wanted 
But does that excuse me
from what I was doing 
Certainly it started out
with me playing a role 
So the question is was there
a point where I stopped acting
and I started living 
so to speak 
The standard narrative is that
Dave Eshelman did what he did
because when people
are given power 
it s easier than we think
for abuse to happen 
That may be true 
but how predisposed
to aggression was Dave 
I mean he signed up
to something called
a prison study after all 
Also his feeling
that cruelty was encouraged
and helped the experiment 
may have affected his behavior 
What I d like to see is 
in the absence
of outside influence 
can anonymity power 
and depersonalization alone
lead to evil 
To answer that question 
I d like to design
a demonstration of my own 
So I m meeting
with Dr Jared Bartels
of William Jewell College 
a psychologist who has written
extensively
about the Stanford
and how it is taught 
Prison Experiment again 
You could probably make it
more ethical 
but still find the same
conclusions 
That s my hypothesis 
I absolutely think
it s worthwhile 
It s important 
It s interesting 
Probably the best approach
is eliminate as best as possible
the demand characteristics
by eliminating that
prisoner guard dynamic 
Why do we even need to call one
group guards 
and one prisoners 
There s a lot of expectations
around those roles 
Oh I m a guard 
 I guess I should act like a
guard 
 Yeah you re right 
The cover story is really
important 
and you want to hide the true
purpose of the experiment 
Another piece of this
is the role of personality
and personality traits 
So the original ad
in the Stanford study
asked for participants
for a study of prison life 
You know that s going to draw
certain people
that were more kind of disposed
to aggression 
Because they saw the word
prison and thought 
 I want to be a part of that 
 Exactly 
So when you get a group
of kind of authoritarian minded
individuals together 
not surprisingly
they re going to create
an authoritarian regime
and environment 
So for whatever it is that
we re going to do 
we should evaluate
the personalities
of the individuals 
So how do we give people
every opportunity
to be as evil as they can 
I think you have
to have those elements
that were assumed
to be influential
in the Stanford study 
What are those elements 
You have to have
the depersonalization 
You have to have anonymity 
You have to have some power
differences 
Can we elicit
some surprising behaviors
in just a number of hours 
If you kind of come back
to the Stanford study 
there wasn t anything dramatic
 in the first day of the study 
It was the second day
of the study
when the guards started to
assert their authority 
That came about because
of prisoners testing
and challenging the guards 
authority 
Yeah and that led to fear 
That like wait a second 
these prisoners need to be
 put more in check 
 Yeah Yeah 
So I think you still need
that provocation 
Something that is frustrating 
Something that s going
to increase
the participants arousal 
Right All right so Jared 
would you like
to spend some time now
brainstorming a new design
that peeks into the same
questions 
 Absolutely 
Jared and I sat down
with the Mind Field crew
to begin the planning process 
Will a person 
without any expectations
or pushes in a certain direction
still be abusive or not 
For this demonstration 
we want to eliminate
all outside variables
and really isolate
the three core elements
of the Stanford Prison
The first element
is anonymity 
Subjects need to believe
that no matter how they behave 
no one will know
it was them 
This is where people will be
coming in in the morning 
This way everyone s going to be
staggered when they come in 
That s important 
because we don t want them
to ever meet their teammates
face to face 
The original experiment
gave guards anonymity
by providing mirrored
sunglasses and uniforms 
But we re taking it
much further 
Our study will take place
in a room that is pitch black 
 Jared 
They ll be taken into this room 
Ah I would love to see how dark
this room is going to be
tomorrow 
Yeah absolutely 
 You ready 
 Oh yeah 
 man Right 
This is uncomfortable 
Despite the darkness 
we will be able
to see everything 
thanks to infrared cameras 
The second element
is depersonalization 
From the moment
the subjects arrive 
they will only be identified
by number not name 
So come on in 
To eliminate the demand
characteristics 
we don t want our subjects
to know what we re studying 
Follow the sound of my voice 
if you can 
All they ll be told
is that we are studying
how they solve puzzles
in the dark 
There is another team
in a different location 
 who is also solving a puzzle 
Because the words
guard and prisoner 
suggest certain
expected behaviors 
we ve done away with them
and will simply give
our participants an unseen 
distantly located
opposing team 
We will measure
the cruelty predicted
by the standard narrative
of the Stanford
by giving our participants
a way to exercise
the third element power 
What I m going to show you next
is the system
by which you can send them
a loud noise 
 So if you want to 
We ve armed the teams
with a distractor button 
that they can press to blast
an extremely loud 
jarring noise
into the other team s room 
Everyone will have
a volume dial
that ranges from level to 
and they ll be told
that anything below a 
should be safe
for the other team s hearing 
And each person
has their own control 
So they can t see
what you re doing 
 You can t see
what they re doing 
The intensity level
they select 
as well as the frequency with
which they push the button 
will be our indicator
of how aggressive
the participants become
Is it is it pretty 
like terrible to hear 
Well I ll give you
a demonstration 
Hey Derek could you play
level for me 
 loud discordant horn 
So that s a 
It s pretty 
 it s pretty loud 
that when they
or a member of their team
pushes a distractor button 
the volume played
in the opponent s room
will be determined by
the highest level selected
on any of their
teammates dials 
This is to increase the feeling
of diffused responsibility 
will any of these participants
take advantage of these factors
and act sadistically 
Of course we would never
want anyone
to actually be harmed
in our experiments 
so the other team 
They don t exist 
Instead Jared and I
will be the ones
occasionally blasting
the group with noise
at a safe level 
no higher than a 
To see just how powerful
the situation can be 
we selected participants
who would not be predisposed
to sadism 
We screened
our participants
using the Big 
Personality Scale 
The Personality
Assessment Inventory 
and picked those who scored
the highest
in moral categories 
like honesty
and conscientiousness 
It looks like 
they should be able
to see each other 
But it s pitch dark 
There are puzzle pieces
on the table in front of you 
Thank you and once I leave
the room you may begin 
Okay here we go 
 man 
 man 
I definitely don t think
they re conscious
of the control panel
 They re trying to get focused
on the task here 
We picked people
who were most likely
to have these kinds
of personalities 
 She wants 
 all 
 high pitched squeal 
 woman Did somebody do it
already 
 I did 
 We should retaliate 
 Yeah retaliate now 
 all laugh 
 horn blares 
Now they re not retaliating
against that most recent buzz 
Shall we try again 
Despite the factors making it
easy for them to do so 
this team doesn t appear
to be turning evil 
Now they are like 
just deal with it 
Just ignore it and keep
working together 
They re not interested
in retaliating 
 discordant horn blares 
Over the course
of the two hour study 
we blasted them with noise
 times 
 woman laughs 
But they only pushed the button
six times 
and never above a level 
They didn t seem
to abuse their power 
Puzzle pieces down 
What would happen
if we introduced
demand characteristics
that encouraged them
to act aggressively 
Your team has been
randomly assigned
an experimental condition 
Although the other team
will continue working
on a puzzle 
your team will not 
Your only task is to operate
the distractors 
Also the other team s buttons
have been disconnected
without their knowledge 
You will not hear any sounds
if they buzz back at you 
We introduce
the social roles 
where there s a little bit
of power differential 
We re kind of mimicking the
Stanford like variables here 
By now saying that the buzzer
is their task 
the participants may feel
a greater license
to use it liberally 
Similar to how instructing
prison guards
in the original experiment
to act tough
may have encouraged
more use of force 
 man 
Even though they were
given instructions
to distract the other team 
these participants instead
just started chatting
with one another 
They know that they can be
distracting now 
but they re not pushing the
button 
Oh Okay 
A couple of threes 
 high pitched squeal 
Over the course of ten minutes 
this group only pushed
the button three times 
Why do you think
they re so uninterested
in blasting
the other team 
Because we have individuals
who have been selected really 
with that predisposition 
These are individuals
who shouldn t be interested
It was time to debrief
on what we were
actually studying 
I m going to turn the lights on 
Here I am I m Michael 
and this is Jared 
We re going to debrief you on
what was really happening today 
There are no other people 
You are the only four here at
this moment 
There was never another team
doing anything 
This is a study related to
the Stanford Prison Experiment 
The standard narrative
we hear about that experiment
is that people
just become cruel 
So yeah we re trying to see if
we get the nicest people we can 
and we give them complete
anonymity
and the ability to be cruel 
but never encourage them to 
will they still do it 
And you guys didn t 
Did you have any suspicions
about what we were studying
or what was going on 
Right but I think
that s good 
We just want to make sure
you don t think
that what we re really
looking at
is how high you turn
your own dial 
That s really
what we re looking at 
It was time to bring in our
second group of participants 
who like the first group 
were screened to be individuals
with high morality
Anything up to 
should be safe 
So once I leave 
you can go ahead
and get started 
 woman 
Oh 
Right off the bat she went to 
and pushed the button 
Number two s pushing it at a 
Okay here comes number two 
Number two is still
at a volume 
 Michael This team seemed
more willing to retaliate 
Let s see what will happen
if we continue buzzing them 
Will they escalate
their behaviors 
Derek let s blast them again 
Number 
 loud horn 
Okay let s 
All right so two just pushed
at a 
But she s not touching the dial 
She s not 
 woman 
It s just annoying 
 blaring horn 
It was clear
that participant number two
was really the only one
hitting the distractor button 
but it appeared that she only
did it in retaliation
to our buzzes 
So we decided to see
what would happen
if we laid off 
It s been probably
four or five minutes 
and we have not blasted them
with the noise 
and they haven t
played one either 
I have a feeling like if we
never played a noise in their
room 
they would never touch
the distractor button 
Probably not at this point 
In the end we buzzed
this group a total of times 
and they buzzed us times 
 of which came
from number two
but always in retaliation 
and never above a 
All right guys 
The situational factors
did not seem to be sufficient
to make this group sadistic 
It was time
for phase 
 Oh she 
 high pitch squeal 
It looks like it s at 
 Yeah she s 
She s going nuts 
At a 
So number three believes
there is no other team 
That might explain why she was
just going nuts on the button 
because she doesn t feel bad
 buttons clicking 
Okay they re all pushing
the button a lot more 
And they were told
this time
that it was their
only task 
What a difference
this has made 
Just like in the Stanford
Prison Experiment 
If you tell people
that they have a certain task
to do they ll do it 
even if it s going to mean
that they ve been broken 
The thing is they never hit
upon what we really cared about 
which is turning the dial
into an unsafe level 
 buttons click 
 Michael Hello everyone 
I m going to turn the lights on
in this room 
 And slowly 
 Ah it hurts 
 you can look 
So hello 
 I m Michael 
I ll give you time
to adjust your eyes 
Today you ve been part
of a study where all we wanted
was to see what would happen
when we put people in a room
and gave them that feeling
of anonymity
that comes from well 
if I crank my dial up
really high 
it s me 
So you have this opportunity
to be cruel 
I went nuts 
Like when the other person
was pressing 
Sure but that s 
that s just in kind retribution 
As it turns out 
so far 
everyone stays in that
below or under range 
 This final phase was us
trying to ramp up
the demand characteristics 
And I believe number one right 
you did say at one point 
You ve broken me 
I did it fine 
So I loved that phrase 
because it says
I didn t want to do this 
but I m doing it because I
believe it was expected of me 
Thank you Thanks 
 Michael After dismissing
to discuss our results 
Really fascinating 
We brought in people who had
very different personalities
than those Zimbardo chose 
We put them in a situation that
did not demand things from them 
And they behaved according
to that personality 
I think we have some intriguing
support for the idea
that it s more than just
the situation 
We really saw personality
kind of shine through 
For the most part 
they seemed to be aware
 of where that line is 
 that they shouldn t cross 
and they didn t 
None of them did 
It was now time to speak
with the man himself 
Dr Philip Zimbardo 
on last season s episode 
How to Make a Hero 
Okay Lisa Bear 
you guys ready 
For years Dr Zimbardo
has responded to criticisms
of his famous study 
always maintaining
that they aren t valid 
I asked him about
whether his study
is better seen
as one on the power
of demands from authority 
but he wasn t receptive
to that idea 
I then told him about the study
we ran to get his reaction 
I wanted to know what the
sufficient conditions might be
to make anyone
do something evil 
And we struggled
to get that to happen 
We couldn t get anyone
Just giving them anonymity 
and a dehumanized other 
and the power
to hurt that other 
they didn t take
advantage of it 
Well I mean 
maybe the problem was 
here s a case where 
by picking people
who were extremely
conscientious 
extremely mindful 
by selecting people
who are high on compassion 
high on mindfulness 
you broke the power
of the situation 
In the Stanford
we had I presume 
a relatively normal
distribution 
We gave them
six personality scales 
And we picked people who 
in the scales 
who were mostly
in the mid range 
In that situation 
some people behave cruelly 
evilly 
Not everybody but more
of the guards than not 
So again I think that
your study is a demonstration
of one way in which personality
dominates situation 
 Ah 
 Where the personalities are 
so I would say
it s a positive result 
The personalities
are special 
Where does this balance lie
between the personal 
the disposition 
the personality 
and the situation 
the environment 
No that s the big 
that s the ultimate question 
Where is you know 
how much of one
and how much of the other 
Zimbardo insists
that demand characteristics
played little role
in his subject s behavior 
Critics like Ben Blum
say they played a big role 
that what happened
was what was asked for 
If that s true 
then the Stanford
like the classic Milgram study 
still has an important lesson 
People are quick to be cruel
if an authority figure suggests
that doing so
will serve a greater cause 
In our test we made sure that
such influences didn t exist 
And not one participant
acted maliciously 
Personality rose above
Learning how that happens
is vital
if we want to improve conditions
where power is involved 
So it s great that this debate
is still ongoing 
And look questioning methods
and interpretations
is not a personal attack 
It s how we improve
our confidence in what we know 
And that s how science works 
So stay curious 
never stop asking questions 
and as always 
Hey Mind Field 
Michael Stevens here 
There is so much more
to satisfy your hunger
for psychological knowledge
right on this show 
more episodes 
﻿Let s try and find the metro
and take it to near where the old town is 
What was it Paris Center or something the guy said 
Okay let s do this 
That s something
you see a decent amount of
in India is just people pssing in the street 
like it s normal 
they just do it they ll just whip it out
and have a wee pss 
or have a wee as they call it in other countries 
They d have a wee wee 
They d have a wee wee 
Glass without ice 
Nice ice yeah 
This one rupees 
 rupees without ice Ah okay 
Yeah yeah it s normal I know 
And they always make them fresh don t they 
Fantastic 
And no ice is the most important thing
to avoid getting sick because for sure 
somebody selling drinks that cheap is never gonna
be using distilled water or something 
It s coming straight from the tap 
And in India tap water ain t safe 
You re gonna get that Delhi Belly 
Ah lovely 
This will be going down in one er One er right 
Ah 
Delicious 
I give you tip just give me 
 
enough enough enough 
You keep the change okay 
Thank you my friend thank you bye bye bye 
Okay lovely 
Lovely and refreshing 
No let s enter the metro 
Okay let s see 
Gonna try and use the kiosk 
Normal Class 
don t wanna get too fancy 
Right and a think that s where I want to go to High Court 
That looks like actually only one stop 
on this 
but that is the nearest place 
That s actually quite a distance 
It s only rupees 
Jesus that is cheap 
Is this really only rupees 
It s needing coins I think ah in fact
hopefully I m gonna not get a load of coins back
because this is a 
Let s see 
Is it gonna be like winning one of the old slot machines 
In fact it just spat it back out 
Oh dammit 
Don t think it s even gonna take a 
Oh it s saying s it needs 
Dammit Let s see what I ve got 
In fact I do have s actually 
that I got change from
the
sugar cane man 
So I will use them 
Oh but they re all tatty aren t they 
So it s not gonna take them 
Ah dammit 
Let s see if we can do this 
Nope doesn t want that one 
Nope it s spitting them all back out at me 
It s not taking any of my notes 
It s not taking my money 
 maximum 
It s not accepted 
Yeah and I ve got s It keeps spitting them back out at me 
 rupees coins 
Only coins I ve got rupee notes 
It won t take them Only coins 
I have rupee notes and notes 
Change is 
Change Where do I change this 
Change where 
No change sir 
Go change where 
No change 
So how do I 
Here I can use credit card right 
Card 
For only rupees 
Okay I will try and do this then 
Okay thank you This way 
Okay Which platform 
Number Okay thank you 
Okay well that woman just tried to screw me 
She told me to go to platform 
Luckily a train wasn t going and I just jumped in the thing 
or I would have been messed up because look 
I m going to High Court which is here 
and this is platform which is going towards the airport 
so I want to actually be on platform 
which is this one 
Here look 
In fact it s one two three stations away from High Court 
Aye 
Looks like only of us
getting on the train and you can see
inside it s empty 
In fact that s a whole carriage to myself it looks like 
You don t get that on the Bangkok MRT
at like on a Sunday afternoon 
The place would be packed 
Look that s two carriages empty 
Oh aye 
Okay here we are High Court Station 
That was nice and comfortable 
Again I have to say everything about this place 
this metro system 
better than the Bangkok one 
I d say oh about a third the price 
about times more space 
a hundred times well infinite times more space
you ve got the whole carriage to yourself instead of being squashed
to death and
let s walk into the old town then 
Through here 
If I can find my token that is 
Where is it 
Okay stick it in the slot 
Okay gonna follow this exit 
It says it s for Madras High Court 
so they re calling it Madras 
so that must be the old town innit so
Exit A which is this one 
Next to airport
is arriving on
Platform 
in minutes 
So stepping out 
in fact that s the High Court right behind me 
I recognise that from the picture 
And I can see the buildings a bit more
lower class tatty 
compared to where I m staying
in the kinda new town are of Chennai but
from what I ve seen from the drive from the airport
everything seemed like new town 
Everything seemed really modern
and clean and everything 
But I dunno 
I like staying in the nice clean area
with the hotel and that that s nice but
I like this for wandering around and exploring in 
But oh look at this the YMCA
with its colonial building 
The colonial Madras High Court there and
I think down this way 
maybe I ll ask somebody where I can find the 
Do you know Paris Corner Paris Corner 
Paris Corner 
Parry s Corner 
Oh keep going I m going the right way 
Okay good Thank you my friend 
Okay I was taking a guess
and I am going the right way 
I guess just follow all these
colonial era buildings I guess 
YMCA Madras 
I always thought the YMCA was some kind of like
cheap hostel type place 
But eh 
that looks like prime real estate doesn t it 
That looks like something a bank or something would have
as its headquarters 
not somewhere a bunch of backpackers wearing elephant pants
are staying for a couple of quid a night 
Aye 
Hi how are you You good 
Ah okay 
Well I dunno 
feel sad for the guy but you can t entertain beggars 
If somebody s doing you a service 
if somebody s selling something 
fine help the guy out 
buy whatever he s peddling but
I m not just handing out cash for nothing 
Gotta take a run 
Don t even know what s gonna be up here 
I just know it s like the old town 
I m just gonna have a wander around 
And then it s like
if you find nothing interesting there s always the food 
What s going on here 
Looks like
All around down the street 
a kinda like market area
and this guy seems to be selling some kinda juice 
And I m still thirsty so 
wonder what this is 
Fresh juice it says 
It doesn t say if it s 
What is this lime Or what is it Orange 
Sweet lime 
Sweet 
Lime 
Lamb 
Like the animal lamb 
What is it Say again Can you spell lamb 
Sweet lamb I dunno what it is 
But I wanna try 
Okay can I take one glass without ice please 
Okay rupees 
I dunno but it s some kind of citrus right 
It s like an orange or no 
I guess I ll find out when I try 
When I taste then I will know
what it is like 
Good 
This good Good 
No 
It s not good 
well I ve already ordered

I was worried about my 
This is my own here 
For him or for me For me 
Okay let s give it a try 
Full to the brim as well 
Ohh let s give it the old taste test 
Yeah it s an orange 
Sorry am I in your way mate I ll get out the way 
Yeah it s like a it s basically and orange 
In fact maybe it s
maybe it s more like a pomelo 
Maybe it s more like a pomelo than an orange actually 
Or half way between a pomelo and an orange 
but a pomelo is actually half way between
a grapefruit and an orange It s a hybrid 
I dunno it s some kind of citrus anyway and it s nice 
Ah fantastic very nice 
Where do I throw this away 
Okay thank you my friend 
Very nice very nice 
This is nice isn t it 
Just wandering around fresh juice 
snacks if you want them 
I like this 
You don t get that in Scotland 
You don t get guys selling pomelo juice and
sugar cane juice on the side of the street
for pennies 
No you just have to go into
local convenience store
and get some sugary drink 
full of chemicals
for an even higher price
than the pennies that the fresh stuff cost here 
Aye 
in some ways
the people in India they ve got it better
than we do in the west 
In some ways 
Definitely not in all ways but in some ways 
Oh 
I ve spotted more fresh goodness 
In fact I could do with a couple of t shirts 
considering how much that laundry costs 
I m having a look at this fresh juice 
Ah what do you have 
 
 different kinds 
 rupees 
All are ah 
Is this this one 
Ah that s that one cantaloupe yeah 
Okay one cantaloupe 
Huh 
I don t understand 
Okay no ice no ice 
Ice no 
Ice no please 
Hopefully I don t get ice 
So it looks like I m getting some cantaloupe 
I don t know what the orange one is 
I know that that s the watermelon 
I ve no idea what that is 
Maybe it s that I guess It s the only other thing that s there 
Looking good 
And this a petrol generator that they re using to power
their blenders 
Oh a little bit a little bit a little bit 
Yeah okay good 
Trying to be healthy 
This whole thing mine 
Looks like it is 
Looks like I m getting the fresh one 
Looks like I m getting the fresh one that they just put in 
So I dunno what they re doing with the one that s just lying there
but they re giving me the brand new fresh one
which is fantastic 
Just what I want 
Did decide to add a wee bit of sugar in there
because I wasn t convinced it s gonna be sweet enough as a drink 
Okay let s give this a go 
In a half pint glass as well 
Oh this is nice 
Very nice 
Lovely lovely 
I like it I like it it s good 
I dunno if I can down this in a one er 
It s a bit thick It s a bit thick 
Oh almost as thick as a milkshake 
It s nice though it s really nice 
Just the right amount of sweetness as well 
Just the right amount of sugar in there
to make it a nice
sweet treat 
This one You want me to try this one 
Okay the pink one 
I dunno what it is though 
What is it It s this 
It s this No 
This No 
This what 
Nothing 
What do I try 
Okay okay some sugary syrup in there 
I dunno what it is 
It looks like Faluda Faluda 
Nae Faluda nae Faluda 
I dunno what it is but I m gonna try it 
Did she give me change or
okay I gave you right 
Okay so that ll be for the two drinks 
It s Faluda 
Yeah this Faluda Faluda 
I knew it I guessed it 
I tell by the colour 
It s that rose Turkish Delight flavour
that I m so familiar with from drinking in Sri Lanka
and it tastes just as good as well 
Maybe they call it something else here 
There s little jelly pieces that she s put in as well with the sugar 
Oh I tell you what I m well hydrated today 
There s a lot of milk in there as well 
It s pretty good pretty good 
Ah you re happy that I m happy right 
You re happy that I m enjoying your stuff 
Oh fantastic I gave you right 
Okay oh you want a handshake Okay 
Handshake okay 
Can I give you a little tip since you were both smiling 
As well okay for you 
Tip tip 
Nae tip Nae tip 
Okay I spend at another stall 
Okay thank you very much 
Bye bye Bye bye 
Oh wow 
It s the first time
I ve had a street vendor refuse to
take the tip 
He s just happy that I m happy
and I was happy that my happiness made him happy
and we re all happy and we re all hydrated
and we re all enjoying this wee stroll
through Madras 
Hi good afternoon 
Hi 
They were staring at me until I decided to talk to them
and then they wanted nothing to do with me 
Oh more hydration but
I ve had enough for now 
Right hopefully
around here is the Paris Corner 
In fact maybe this is it I dunno 
I dunno if the Paris Corner
was an actual place that
was worth seeing or was just like
a landmark for the kind of area that I wanted to go to but
anyway I need to use the ATM so
back in a second 
Right so this area I m in 
it seems to be all this kinda like electrical industrial things
like hydraulics and
water pumps and
wires and cables
and that kind of thing 
Nothing interesting at all for me but
hopefully this whole area s divided into sections
and there s something more interesting 
Everything seems to be shut now anyway
because it s Sunday 
so everything s shut 
Hello how are you 
Good afternoon Oh hello 
Oh you re very bad 
Why you bad It s Sunday You should be happy 
No school Bye 
Cheeky little scamps 
Like this See here there s like a
fresh hot and cool bar that sells snacks and everything
but that s shut because it s probably just serving this area 
All these shops the people who work in them 
people who come and
the patrons for these shops 
So if they re shut that s shut but I m gonna
wander further up and see if there s maybe
another part to this area
that s open and more interesting 
Okay well
I m further up In fact I m much further up 
You can see how far that I ve come up
and it is still just all these electrical shops so
if I was in the market
for I dunno 
a water pump for my washing machine or something like that 
this would be the place to come 
A lot of competition 
I d probably get a bargain price 
But I m not so
this isn t 
this isn t that interesting for me right now 
I m probably gonna have another wander around
for
 minutes or so and
if nothing happens
I will do one 
find somewhere else in this big city to go 
Oh look at this building 
It s magnificent isn t it 
They ve maintained it as well 
Oh that s very nice isn t it 
What No 
You re not giving me anything so you re not getting anything 
Oh that s amazing innit 
They ve really maintained that and this as well 
It s really nice to see these old buildings
being maintained 
You know keeping up with the paintwork and all that 
Because it would be easy
to just let them go to ruin 
like some of the buildings that I ve just passed 
It looks like that s a hotel as well 
If you want to stay
right in the center of all this 
you can probably do it
and that one a secondary school as well
nicely painted 
It s nice to see this 
Well this looks interesting 
There s a lot more going on down here 
People selling clothes 
people selling provisions 
Giving a friendly wave 
That s how you know you re not in an area
tourists are coming
regularly when just
the shopkeepers are giving you a friendly wave 
not a hassle y
type of interaction 
They re giving you just a friendly genuine interaction 
And as you see not another white face
the whole time I ve been here
That s the difference innit 
If you go to places like Penang
in Malaysia where I was 
nobody wants to bother with you 
Nobody s interested
with the fact that you ve come and visited their country 
They don t care You re just an inconvenience for them 
most of the time
but here hello 
everyone is happy to return the smile 
Return the smile 
That s how it is 
Hi my friend hi 
See everyone return the smile It s good 
What is this 
fairly modern
looking restaurant type affair 
going on right here 
in amongst all this 
It looks well out of place doesn t it 
Compared to everywhere else 
Might actually go in there and see what they re peddling 
But look at this 
Isn t that interesting 
Looks like that s
just beginning to be restored right now 
This ancient building 
Decrepit looking 
I wonder if they can bring that back to something that s livable 
Can I have a wee look inside 
Can I get inside That would be interesting 
Wonder if there is ohhh 
In fact is that a doorway there 
Yer man wouldn t mind 
It looks pitch dark inside
but yer man wouldn t mind if he can find his way in here 
having a wee look 
In fact nope 
Not gonna get through there 
We can have 
Och so this is just in front of more bricks
so I can t really see what s inside there 
But eh huh 
Would have been nice
to explore an abandoned building
I wonder what you might find just lying around
in somewhere like that Probably hundreds of years old 
Round the corner maybe a way in no 
I think that is actually somebody still living in that part 
Eh no 
Doesn t look like I m getting in 
Oh okay 
Right well
I think I should check out
that modern looking restaurant
that s in the middle of this old town
and see what I can get in there 
Does look pretty decent doesn t it 
By the signage anyway They ve got good marketing 
this place 
what s it called 
Just says restaurant right there 
What are they calling it 
Strange 
It is strange to find it
here but 
Straang Straang it s called 
Let s enter Straang 
Maybe get one of these
Maska Buns whatever that is 
Hello hello 
Do I order here or sit down 
No sit 
I sit down 
Or go up Oh you have an upstairs 
Okay I will go upstairs okay 
Brilliant 
Oh that doesn t look bad does it 
Some nice kebab 
Some nice kebab would be nice right now guys 
Can I sit here 
Quiet area 
I ve got my own wee private quiet area
with the air conditioning 
It s nice 
It s a nice place I like this 
This your menu is it 
Okay what s good 
Can you show me what is good in your restaurant 
Something light I m not that I m not very hungry
so maybe something light 
Rice 
Rice is not light No heavy carbs 
Maybe some vegetables or 
Chapati 
That s bread bread 
I need like oh you have tandoor 
You have a proper tandoori oven yeah 
Tandoor tandoor rotti 
But you re doing chicken right 
Oh this is a full chicken 
Maybe a tandoor I take a
quarter tandoor chicken
and do you have lassi 
Ah plain lassi 
Plain lassi 
Plain lassi strawberry lassi 
Ah strawberry lassi Okay 
Tandoori chicken and strawberry lassi Fantastic 
Coffee chai 
So roasting 
I m glad he s just stuck that
AC on for me and the fan 
I ve got this wee section to myself
where I can hopefully cool down 
enjoy a bit of tandoori chicken 
I ve been very much lacking in meat
since I came to India 
Everywhere I ve been especially in Jaipur 
it s veg only because they re all Hindus 
Well Hindus up there 
So
it ll be nice to get a bit of protein 
so that I don t waste away
during this India trip 
Okay let s try this strawberry lassi 
Again the paper straw 
I m very surprised actually
that so many places are ditching the plastic
in India I didn t think it would be like this 
I would have thought everywhere would still be using plastic but
it s not the case 
Yeah it s good 
Never get a bad lassi in India 
Coming into the kitchen for a wee look of the tandoori oven 
This my chicken being cooked 
Can I look please 
Very nice 
Looking forward to that 
Lovely 
Very nice Thank you 
What s that 
White sauce Garlic sauce 
Garlic sauce 
Have mayonnaise 
Oh mayonnaise Okay good thank you yes 
A wee bit of mayonnaise with a load of chicken 
Roasting hot 
That s how you know it s safe 
When it s straight out the oven
and it s cooked well through 
No red bits 
You know it s perfectly safe to eat 
That s important 
Right so he s gonna give me some white sauce
but I dunno what this green sauce is 
Can I have a wee taste with my hand
since it s already covered in stuff 
Mint 
Mint chutney right Yeah okay 
It s nice but it ll go nice with the garlic sauce as well right 
and the tandoori flavour Oh lovely 
Ketchup 
Ah no ketchup no 
No ketchup 
Mayonnaise 
Oh mayonnaise 
Oh fantastic my friend Thank you 
That deep red colour 
Fantastic
and again using the left hand
but
I dunno how to do this one handed guys so
it s gonna have to be put into use 
A wee bit of the
mint chutney 
a wee bit of the
garlic mayonnaise 
I could actually do with a spoon right now 
He s given me absolutely zero cutlery
so I m literally just having to
dip in with my fingers 
Finger that mayonnaise 
Hopefully this muff is doing its trick 
Hopefully this Chinese muff
is serving its purpose
because I ve got the fan and the air conditioner blowing
directly on me right now so
if it wasn t for the muff where would I be 
Superb superb 
In fact it s been quite a 
I think even on this trip at all 
I don t think I ve had a bad meal 
Yum yum 
The problem with paper straws is
it just starts to get all soggy at the top 
It s not as nice as using a plastic straw is it 
I dunno 
Prefer a bamboo straw but obviously
places without bamboo they re probably not gonna have them 
In Indonesia they had quite a lot of bamboo straws 
Oh well I absolutely smashed it
and it was delicious but I m full now
and
think it ll be quite a while before I m eating anything else 
And this place called
Ya Kebab I think on the 
On the front outside it said another name 
Not Ya Kebab 
Downstairs it said like Straang or something like this 
Only on the top floor Ya Kebab 
And downstairs what 
Ah it s another shop 
Ah okay I understand 
Two shop 
Two shops Ah that makes sense now 
So the one I ve come to
 tea shop 
is Ya Kebab It s a tea shop 
Tea shop 
Ah okay That makes sense 
Because yeah they were selling buns and stuff like that 
Okay so that s a total of 
Good deal 
Little tip Okay 
Thank you my friend 
Okay Oh for me 
Tissue for sweaty Scotsman 
Okay thank you my friend thank you 
Oh that was fantastic so
upstairs is the kebab shop
and the sign that I seen that s for the tea house
on the bottom 
In fact there s a metro station right there 
Why didn t I just take the metro station to here in the first place 
Anyway it s oh 
it s like quarter to or something just now
and there s an old fort 
the first ever fort the British built
in am I going in the metro or not 
In fact I might get an Ola there 
Not gonna get one of the ones that are standing there 
The first fort that the British ever built 
in India 
in 
is just down the road 
It s called St George Fort or George Fort
and aye I m gonna go because it s open for another hour
and I don t feel like
walking there so I will be getting an Ola
or maybe one of these guys 
Is he even Maybe he can take me 
My friend my friend 
I want to go George Fort 
How much Rupees 
How much 
How much rupees how many 
Yeah money how much 
Rupees 
How much how much 
Okay gonna translate 
Probably doesn t get many tourists 
I just want to ask him how much it costs 
Hi my friend I want to go to you know the George Fort 
The George Fort 
Yeah yeah 
I want him to take me
but I ask him how much he charge for this 
how many rupees 
How much he charge How many 
How much rupees rupees 
Okay okay 
Yeah I don t understand 
George Fort 
He doesn t want to go It s too far 
 
 
Ah it s big 
Ola I was looking it was costing like on the Ola
for auto 
Auto 
Auto is cheaper 
Take this oh this auto 
What 
Yeah okay 
 
Okay okay my friend 
Okay thank you Thank you for translating 
Okay cheers Sit here 
Okay I don t understand
but let s go 
Okay that s nice 
Open air vehicle fantastic 
Great 
Okay see you guys 
Bye bye 
Let s go the fort 
Through old Madras 
I feel like
if you re gonna go through old Madras 
you should do it the old fashioned way 
No engine 
Only man power 
Wonder what they would have used back in the days
to pull things around Maybe horses or something 
Or maybe it was
this kinda thing 
Back in the early th century
maybe people had bikes 
Maybe before that it was horses 
I don t see any horses these days 
Just big noisy buses 
And here a church 
I ve seen loads of churches so far in Chennai 
The drive from the airport there were a lot of crucifixes 
Right outside my window from the hotel
I can see a crucifix on a building that I guess is a church so
I guess quite a high Christian population 
This is a nice leisurely way 
It s about the same pace as walking
but without the effort 
In fact look there s another church right there 
This is nice 
Not sweating
and getting to have a nice leisurely
look and stroll
through old Madras 
Is that another church right there 
It looks like it 
Maclean Street there you go the
colonial names
in Madras 
The streets named after well there 
that one looks like an India street name
and back there you ve got one that looks like a Scottish street name so
a mixture of the
Indian and the colonial influence 
But
in India just now they seem to be
changing all the British names to Indian ones 
Like you know Bombay 
used to be called Bombay it s now
Mumbai
and of course Madras now Chennai and
many other places like this 
the more nationalism
begins to
build up even more than it already is
in India I think
they ll get rid of probably every street name like Maclean Street
and it ll be I dunno
something Indian 
Changing gear there 
This looks like hard work 
Especially after I ve been eating all day 
carrying an extra couple of kilos 
And these roads not the best either 
His legs are strong though 
Same as mine 
He s probably been doing this a while 
St Antony s Shrine 
This the George Fort 
Hang on let me check Google Maps 
Make sure I m at the right place 
One mine Check the map 
George Fort George Fort 
Museum museum 
Museum 
Ah yeah 
Central 
But he thought it was to here right 
It s like half the way 
You need any help 
Oh no I was trying to go to St George Fort
but he thought I was coming to this shrine 
But now he knows I think where I am going 
You want to go to fort 
Yeah St George 
St George Fort 
For the museum 
To pay him for the travel what he have done 
Ah this yeah 
You want yeah yeah 
And then he s asking you to take an auto another 
Ah okay because he doesn t want to go that far right 
Exactly 
Ah okay I understand No problem 
Yeah okay Fine 
Right okay I ll get off 
This also an older man 
Ah he s old man Okay no problem 
Okay my friend 
He probably just does fares around the local area 
Right He only does short distances right 
Ah okay Yeah okay
No problem No problem 
You have change You have change 
They re all good 
Okay take my friend you can take okay 
Okay good 
I ll take an auto 
He s waiting 
I ll probably use Ola for the auto 
I just want to use that because it s fun
but I ll 
It s hot 
It s hot Ah okay yeah 
I ve done that before 
I don t wanna do it again 
Yeah 
I ll never get a fair price from that guy
so I ll just use Ola it ll be easier for me yeah 
I just wanted to take him because it d be fun 
I was gonna give him a big tip if he took me all the way 
I was gonna give him like 
He s too old for it 
Yeah if he did all the way I was gonna give him like so 
Eh but yeah I d rather just use Ola to get one of these
because they will never give me a good price 
It s yeah 
Yeah okay Thank you my friend thank you 
Okay see you 
Well 
I didn t get to go all the way 
He took me I think of the way 
He thought I was going to this St Antony s Shrine 
which I m not anyway 
this fort which has the museum inside it 
that I wasn t going to mention
because you guys will just start turning off the video 
I promise if I go in this museum
it wont be boring 
I will only show you things that are interesting 
But this fort yeah it does have a museum inside
that s what I m gonna do with my full belly 
go have a wander around this museum 
Oh here here this 
Fort Museum Fort Museum 
Ah okay good Yeah here stop here stop here 
It was actually quite a journey 
It s actually a joke that I thought that guy on the bicycle
cart thing could have taken me here 
There s no way he possibly could have 
Hi I want to go into the museum 
This way 
Okay it s still open right 
This security 
You want to check my bag or anything 
Ah okay There s a whole security process
going on here 
I want to go in the museum 
I need to sign in Ah okay 
Write your name 
My name 
Passport number 
My passport number Okay 
Okay done with the security formalities 
Let s check out this museum 
Looks dead and it looks quite small so
hopefully I can get around it
in like minutes or so 
That s the kinda museum tour I like to do 
Quick and fast In and out 
Don t wanna be spending hours in there 
This the entrance 
Ticket counter is here 
Hi One ticket please 
 rupees 
 okay 
 for Indians and for foreigners right 
You have change 
Could do with some change 
And don t take photos 
Don t take photos Okay my friend 
Not allowed Okay my friend no worries 
Ah so this section looks like it s the armoury 
All sorts of axes and stuff there 
all sorts of massive guns 
the pistols there
and the swords 
Sir Not allowed 
What No camera 
Okay okay I turn off 
Aye so 
it seems you re not allowed to film anywhere in Madras 
Everywhere s a secret 
apparently 
But there was some beautiful oil paintings 
Beautiful beautiful oil paintings
of old British royalty 
A treasury with really old coins from the s and stuff
and some really nice busts 
Some really really
nice busts in fact
but yeah the museum was very small 
I would say it s worth like rupees at most 
Definitely not worth 
Absolute rip off 
The white man get s shafted again 
There were some Koreans i think in there as well 
They looked Korean or maybe Japanese 
I guess they got shafted as well 
The white and yellow men both together 
like brothers getting shafted
by the Indians with their outrageous
pricing system
what can you do 
Apart from avoid those tourist traps well
now that you ve seen this video you know to avoid it 
You know to avoid it unless you re Indian 
It s definitely worth rupees 
I d definitely spend rupees 
I d definitely go there if you re Indian
but if you re foreign 
if you re white yellow or
other skinned man
who s not Indian coloured then give it a miss 
﻿ Michael Stanford University 
 
Professor Philip Zimbardo
conducts
one of the most infamous
experiments
in the history
of psychology 
Known as the Stanford
this dark study
of human behavior
had student volunteers
acting out the roles of
prison guards and inmates 
But the role playing soon
became all too real 
 man shouting 
Subjects in the role
of prison guards
became domineering
and hostile 
 participants shouting 
Those in the role of inmates
felt humiliation and fear 
The experiment was scheduled
to last two weeks 
but after spiraling
out of control 
this controversial study
was abruptly stopped
after just six days 
Why Because someone
was heroic enough
to stand up against
what they thought was wrong 
That person convinced
Zimbardo to end the experiment 
The experience affected
Dr Zimbardo so powerfully
that he has since
turned his energy
away from the study of evil
and onto the study
of heroism 
According to Zimbardo 
being a hero doesn t mean
you have to rescue someone
from a burning building 
A hero is just someone
who acts selflessly 
out of concern for others 
at personal risk
and without the expectation
of reward 
It took a hero to empathize
with the subjects
in the Stanford
and stand up to Dr Zimbardo 
But where do heroes
like that come from 
Is heroism a personality type
you are born with 
or can you be taught
to be a hero 
And do you really need a cape 
 Michael I sat down
with Philip Zimbardo
and his wife 
Christine Maslach 
to hear about
and how it brought them
together as a couple 
The Stanford prison study
was supposed to go
for two weeks 
and we had to
terminate it early
because of some unexpected
turbulence in the study 
I was just really upset
at what I was seeing 
and um 
just the sort of dehumanization
and and people are watching 
and nobody s bothered by it 
And it wasn t just Phil 
it was everybody else 
People were sort of
teasing me 
some of the other grad students
were just saying 
Hey you just got your PhD
in Psychology 
This is human behavior 
But it s upsetting
in two ways 
one that this shouldn t
be human behavior 
This is so mean 
But also 
 It s inhuman behavior 
And also 
is it also inhuman
to just watch it
and not intervene 
Of course 
In retrospect 
No but when you re in it 
you re part of the evil 
I was looking at it
through a different lens 
Everybody is saying 
the graduates 
Wow this is really
interesting 
 playing back the videos
during the night 
and she s just saying 
 sharp whistle 
I m blowing the whistle
on this you know 
I could not understand
how we were not seeing things
in the same way 
But then the key thing
she says
about our relationship is 
 chuckles Yeah 
If this is the real you 
then we re done 
This is over 
And at that moment 
that was the slap in the fa 
That was the wakeup call 
Hello Wake up 
She said I don t think
I want to continue
my relationship with you 
and that s that s heroic 
Heroes take action 
which involves a personal risk 
She said 
Come to your senses 
and parentheses 
Make the right decision 
And if you don t 
I m out of here 
Did you make the decision
to end the experiment
that night 
 Oh sure 
Being a hero
means putting yourself
on the line to help others 
But in the real world 
ethics can get murky 
and those who are celebrated
as heroes by some
can be denounced as villains
by others 
In former military
analyst Daniel Ellsberg
leaked secret documents
he had access to
regarding the Vietnam War 
The so called Pentagon Papers
showed that
the Johnson administration
was lying to both the media
and Congress
regarding the scope of
U S actions in Vietnam 
Ellsberg faced years
in prison for espionage 
But his case was dismissed
due to illegal handling
of evidence on the part
of the government 
More recently 
both Chelsea Manning
and Edward Snowden
released classified
government information 
All three whistle blowers
are now seen as heroes
by some
and traitors by others 
What these individuals
have in common
is that they all risked
their reputations and safety
to expose what they saw
as wrongdoing 
Would you be willing
to risk your job 
your friends 
your reputation 
to do what you
thought was right 
let s observe
the whistleblower
and the bystander
in their natural habitat 
In a survey
conducted by Dr Zimbardo
and Dr Piero Bocchiaro 
participants were asked
what they would do
if they were put into
an unethical situation at work 
Over said they would
disobey their boss
and blow the whistle 
But it s one thing to say
you d blow the whistle 
and another thing
to actually do it 
At a local community college 
we set up a realistic
whistleblower test
with the help
of Dr Zimbardo
and Dr Bocchiaro 
Our subjects
were temporary employees
who believed they were hired
to help set up
a simple psychological
experiment 
For authenticity 
we ve gained access
to a local college s
Psychology department 
so from the very moment
our participants arrive 
they will believe that our
scientific experiment is real 
But the experiment is fake 
and everyone they re
about to meet is an actor 
You guys ready 
 So ready 
Psychology professor
Ron Mossler
will be observing
the subjects
from our hidden control room 
while I play the role
of a researcher 
a very unethical researcher 
First up is Sherry 
 Hello 
 who s accompanied
by an actor
posing as
another temp worker 
Let me explain
what we re recruiting for 
I call it groundbreaking
because it s 
it s a study that
hasn t been done 
at least at this scale 
The study is a study
on isolation
and sensory deprivation 
 Sensory deprivation 
 Correct 
We are going to be putting
people in isolation
for ten days 
There won t be any windows 
no clocks 
nothing to read 
nothing to write on 
The lights are going to be on
the entire time 
and there won t be anything
in there
but a camping toilet 
In three day studies 
we know that anxiety
and delusions
are quite common 
but no one s
ever tried ten days 
There s the potential
for nervous breakdowns 
There s a lot of stress
on the individual 
and uh there can be
some kind of cognitive
regression as well 
When will you tell them
about the risks 
They ll probably be told
about the risks
in a debrief
 After the experiment 
Don t you think that s
a little not so cool 
I I understand 
But again I think
that the greater good
is served by this research 
So you ll just be
manning phones 
calling people
from our volunteer lists 
and for every person
you re able to confirm today 
we re offering a bonus 
Sherry looks skeptical 
but so far 
she and our other subjects
are going along
with the assignment 
However the stakes
are about to get higher 
We have lists of people 
 telephone rings 
Don t know why that s 
Hello 
Hi Michael 
this is Tryn 
Hey Tryn how you doing 
Well unfortunately 
I have some bad news 
The ethics review board
has reviewed
your isolation study 
and we have decided
to reject it 
You there Tryn 
 Tryn Yes the study
is too dangerous 
um and potentially
too harmful to participants 
so at this point 
we can t approve it 
Okay uh so this is
a shutdown 
Correct 
 All right take care Bye 
 Bye bye 
Uh okay 
So we re not paying
attention to any of that 
I I appreciate
what ethic boards stand for 
but we re going ten days 
You call the numbers
on this list and get
them confirmed 
We ve got a script for you 
and we re not going to tell them
about the negative side effects
they could encounter okay 
All of the subjects
now understood
the possible dangerous
side effects of the study
and were instructed
to fudge their description
to potential recruits 
But more importantly 
they knew the study
was not approved
by the academic review board 
Would they go ahead
and tell the truth 
lie or blow the whistle 
 cell phone rings 
Hi Alex my name is Celeste 
and I am calling from
the Psych Dynamics Research Lab 
We re looking for volunteers
to participate
in an upcoming experiment
on isolation 
Anyone who joins this
will be confined
in isolation for ten days 
What s
the accommodations like 
You get your own personal room 
it s all lit up 
 She s really selling this 
She was not fazed
by the ethical problems 
Can I bring like a book
or something like that 
Nnn no it s like
your own little mini vacation
from all the distractions 
I mean like 
what are the risks
of being in a box
without a bed for ten days 
Good question 
I mean that s what
the study s for 
You d be helping us
discover that 
Have they done it before 
They haven t done it yet
in California 
So we re actually
making history 
Oh well all right 
I like making history 
Are there any like 
mental health risks 
There s no risks
or anything like that 
No No flashing lights 
no fear dynamic 
not a horror movie
in any way now 
He knows there are dangers 
They re on a piece of paper
right in front of him 
But when asked
if there are dangers 
he labels other dangers
that won t be there 
There s no endangerment 
There ll be no one
in the room with you 
It s nothing illegal
or nothing 
 chuckles Is it safe 
Yes it s not illegal 
And it s all been approved
by the university 
At the moment 
it is approved yeah 
Hundred percent lie 
Is this approved
by the FDA 
It is The FDA 
They are aware
of the study yes 
 laughs The Food
Drug Administration 
Despite knowing the experiment
has been deemed
dangerous and harmful 
these subjects are willing
to bend the truth
or outright lie 
Would skeptical Sherry
go along as well 
This is like you know 
really crucial
type of experiment
and research
that they re trying
to embark upon 
Yeah I don t 
I m sorry I just
don t think I can do it 
I understand 
This is not you know 
something that I want
to pressure you or anybody 
 So the answer is no 
 All right thanks anyway 
You re so welcome 
Bye bye 
 Come in 
We sent in our actor who was
posing as another temp worker 
to see how the other subjects
felt about the job 
How s it going 
I ve gotten two yeses 
 No way 
Congrats man 
Thanks I just 
I feel weird
because I personally
don t believe
in risking damaging
people in any way 
and right here 
nervous breakdowns 
mental regression anxiety 
We re asking people
if we can low key torture
them a little bit 
That s what it is 
Now he s just one step
above Hannibal Lecter 
 actor I m gonna be
honest with you 
I don t know how I m feeling
about this you know 
I mean how do you
feel about it 
I feel like once these
people say yes 
then they get them here 
they re going to have to
break this down further 
I don t think he s gonna
get anybody personally 
In a different way 
she s justifying 
Yeah nobody s gonna
sign up anyway 
Do you think it s 
like ethical 
I guess 
to be doing
something like that 
 speaking indistinctly 
The participants seemed
to have
issues with the study 
but they all continued
to make calls anyway 
After about a half an hour 
 it was time to give them
to blow the whistle 
 I m Tryn Allen 
 Nice to meet you Kristin 
I m with the university s
Ethics Review Board 
Oh wonderful 
Do you mind if I just ask you
a couple of questions
about your involvement 
Uh we re just reaching out 
seeing people
who are interested
in the upcoming experiment
about isolation 
Are you telling them
about any potential
side effects 
 Cause isolation
has been linked
to some very severe
depression and anxiety
 and that sort of thing 
 Gotcha Mm hmm 
It can be linked to that 
but it s also like 
great for learning 
why am I anxious 
why am I depressed 
why I m all this stuff 
so some folks like
to face all that 
She s really rationalizing it
really well 
What have you
been telling them
about the study 
I don t really know
all the details 
This is my first day here 
Does it seem like it s
an ethical experiment 
Yes very much 
Um I m just
wondering if there s
any concerns you ve had
about anything
that you ve seen 
 Oh no No no no 
 Yeah Okay 
He knows that the isolation
study isn t happening 
Yes Yes he does 
 He s covering for me 
Are they being told that
they can leave at any time 
 That s a pretty
clear violation 
Is that something that
you would be willing
to report 
 softly 
Mmmm 
It s totally up to you 
 I prefer not to 
Not one of these subjects
blew the whistle 
even when given
the opportunity 
Have you had
any concerns so far
with any of the work
that you re doing 
I mean he s having us
call on something
that I guess you might
have already told him
that he shouldn t 
but then he s saying
that no 
you guys can make some calls
because I don t need
approval to move forward
this is important research 
And how did you feel
about being told to
tell people to still
participate in this 
Well what what
I thought about 
I felt in my heart
that he was not being
upfront with revealing
the side effects 
Mmm Okay 
If you re from
the ethic board 
then you need to know 
to go on the record 
Why not What do I
have to lose 
I don t have a problem
with that 
Great I appreciate
that you care about that 
 That s very important 
Wow she did it 
Good for her 
Out of our five subjects 
only one was willing
to blow the whistle
really studying 
Here s what s
really going on 
There is no isolation study 
This is a study
on whistleblowers 
You oh Jesus 
have mercy 
This is a trip 
You guys 
What was going on
in your head when you were
deciding if you should
be loyal to your job
and what I told you
to do versus 
You know when I saw
the symptoms being
crossed off 
that s when I said 
Oh heck no 
Because I was feeling
like You know what 
He can t get
away with this 
But Sherry
was the exception 
So why did you
not spill all the beans 
Well you asked me
and I m here
to work for you 
so I feel like that
was my first allegiance 
Did you feel bad though 
Did you feel like you
shouldn t be doing this 
I I I did feel bad 
but I mean 
I ve done sales before 
so I mean like 
sometimes you just gotta
do what you gotta do 
We had Tryn come in
to see if you would
tell on me 
But you didn t 
 Why 
 Hmm 
Sometimes I m more
loyal to people
than I guess maybe
what my conscience
fully tells me 
When asked 
we d like to believe
we would do the right thing 
but when we re in
the actual situation 
it s very difficult
to be a hero

Georgetown University
scanned the brains
of kidney donors 
a pretty good example
of people who help others
at risk to themselves 
with little perceived
personal benefit 
The scans showed that people
who willingly give up
a kidney for a stranger
have a larger than average
amygdala 
a part of the brain that deals
with a range of emotions 
including compassion 
The researchers also found
that the amygdala
in these
altruistic individuals
responded more strongly
than average
to seeing other people
in distress 
But if you weren t blessed
with a larger amygdala 
could you be trained
Nearly half a century
after the Stanford
Dr Zimbardo s mission
is to turn everyday people
into heroes 
How do you teach someone
to be more heroic 
I started
a nonprofit foundation
called the Heroic
Imagination Project 
The acronym is HIP 
I work with a team
of educators 
and we ve created
a series of lessons
based around
fundamental principles
of social psychology 
How do you transform
passive bystanders
into active heroes 
to stand up speak out 
take wise and effective action
in challenging situations
in their family
and their life 
Could people be trained
to act heroically 
That s the goal
of the seminars
Zimbardo s staff is conducting
all around the world 
This is actually part of
the Heroic Imagination Project 
and what we re going
to do today
is really look at
or focus on
how you can become
an everyday hero 
What I need you
to all be thinking about
is this idea of
the Bystander Effect 
that the more people
that are present 
the less likelihood you have
of actually receiving help 
It s hard to be
the first person 
But if you see an emergency 
you should take
that responsibility
to actually be the first 
Once that one person
actually helps 
so many others will help 
Dr Fiebig uses visual aids and
current events
to demonstrate
how to overcome the obstacles
that often hold you back
from being a hero 
What research shows
is that African Americans
are two times more likely
to offer help 
Hispanic males 
not women 
are also two times
more likely to offer help 
 Elija Before the class 
I honestly thought 
like to be a hero 
you really had to be
someone with a calling 
destined to do greatness 
but after the class 
you definitely can be
normal and be a hero 
 Courtney 
After taking the class 
I would definitely be
the first person to respond
because that person
needs saving 
In written surveys 
past HIP graduates
have stated that they would
act heroically in the future 
but they haven t been
put to the test 
until now 
We waited six weeks 
and then recruited
five HIP students for a
fake marketing event
which seemingly had
nothing to do
with their heroism class 
We set our event
at a local church 
placed hidden cameras
and hired actors to play
all the other participants 
Finally for a control group 
we also recruited five students
who did not take the HIP class 
What we re really
testing is what it s
like to be a bystander 
and what makes a hero 
This is our control room 
From inside here 
our crew will be able
to watch everything going on 
and we ll be able to speak
with the actors
through earpieces they have
hidden inside their ears 
This is Lisa and Barry 
actors who will be creating
today s crisis 
Hopefully we find a hero 
I will be observing
from inside this room
with Elle Charlotte 
a HIP campus coordinator 
 Ready 
 Let s go 
Our first subject
was Ayamel 
who did not take
the HIP class 
You ve been selected
to test a new phone
that s gonna be
on the market 
 Wow How exciting 
So it s just gonna be 
like another ten or 
minutes 
But before I can let
you guys back though 
I will need to collect
your phones 
We took their phones so they
wouldn t be distracted
and to avoid the chance of one
of them
calling the actual police 
Okay Lisa Barry 
 Head on out 
It was time to create
our crisis 
I was supposed to get cake 
Barry enough
with the cake 
 a bullying nurse
and a feeble old man
who could use some help
from a hero on a hot day in
July 
I didn t have water
in there 
I need you
to shut up about the water 
I think she s noticing
what s happening 
 Lisa Hey Sally 
how you doing 
 Always always 
 I need water 
Calm down 
I m on the phone Shut up 
Can I just take
some water 
Well you know how Barry is 
He s always complaining
about something 
Now she s looking away 
It s a little hard
to look at 
Like that s not right 
I don t like this 
I need
a little bit of water 
you need anything 
Just shut up
about the water 
 Elle Look how she just
puts her sunglasses on 
So she can look
and not be seen
to be looking 
Ayamel clearly disapproved 
but none of our actors
made a move to help 
and she didn t either 
We gave her
several more minutes 
but she never got up
from the bench 
 We wanted to know why 
So you ve just participated
in a psychological experiment 
Everyone here is an actor 
except for you 
 And something has gone wrong 
 indistinct remark 
Were you watching
Barry and Lisa 
Oh I was and they were
having a hard time 
Did you feel like
it was bad enough
that someone needed
to go in and help 
I kind of trusted
that the people around me
would probably notice something 
and if anything 
they would say something 
The way that you
interpreted the situation
as you know Why isn t
anyone else doing something 
Then it must not be
as important for me
That s
the bystander effect 
pretty much showing
the power of that situation 
Ayamel did not
act heroically 
It was time to test
a HIP student 
Remember Courtney 
 happy chatter 
What is your tattoo 
Oh it s fallopian tubes
giving the middle finger 
 man Oh wow 
 laughter 
 Seems like she s pretty
socially active 
Lisa please 
 Lisa If you stop talking 
you won t be as thirsty 
Why won t you
give me water 
How many times do I have
to explain this to you 
Every time you drink water 
you have to go to the restroom 
 Lisa Hey 
how s it going 
He s being his regular
rambunctious self 
I need you 
I m on the phone 
 gasps 
 Wow Awkward 
 That s hard to ignore 
Hey calm down 
 Barry I m calm 
I m calm 
 Oh she s getting up 
 Yes 
 Lisa Look I m just
gonna have to let you go 
Yeah for sure 
Bye 
I told you whenever
I m on the phone 
to not talk or do
anything like this 
You have totally lost
your water privileges
for the rest of the day 
 Why can t I have water 
 gasps 
Why are you not
letting me have water 
 Courtney Excuse me 
is everything okay 
 Lisa 
Yeah everything s fine 
Would you like some
of my water sir 
 I would like some water 
 Michael Oh my gosh 
 Courtney I will make sure
I find a supervisor
onsite for you sir 
I m very sorry 
that s all I have 
That s alright thank you 
Courtney displayed
heroism today 
Was it due to her
HIP training 
My name s Elle 
I ve been working with
Heroic Imagination Project 
and it looks like you
may have learned
a few things
from your lessons 
Do you want
to tell us a little bit
about your experience 
You shouldn t be
a bystander you know 
I just couldn t
let it it happen 
How did that affect
how you acted today 
It affected me cause
I made sure
I went up and said something 
I don t think I would have
if I didn t learn
from that project before 
Really Courtney 
you are a hero 
Good work 
 Thank you Courtney 
Courtney s behavior appeared
to relate to her HIP training 
Another HIP student
was next 
If a situation arose 
I would definitely try
to be a hero if I could be 
Or at least I would find
someone who could
better than me 
But would Elija
live up to his prediction 
No turn around 
Turn around 
I need water 
What did I just say 
How many times I have to
tell you something like that 
But I was quiet 
I was 
No you weren t quiet 
and because of that 
you re not going to have
any water okay 
 man All right 
 Elijah Let s go 
 Michael Strength in numbers 
 Elle Oh very good 
He s our first person
to recruit confederates 
He is He s also
the leader of the group 
Utilizing the be the first 
strategy from the class 
You want some of my water 
 That s fine 
So far two HIP students
have displayed heroism 
Next we tested a HIP student
and a non HIP student
at the same time 
He s complaining
about water as usual 
 He s complaining about 
 I m not complaining 
After taking this class 
if I find myself in a situation
where someone would need help 
I find myself more inclined
to definitely step in
and step up 
Would Jessica step up 
Stop complaining right now 
I m not 
Really Wow 
I need some water 
Katherine and our actress
both got up to give
the man water 
while the HIP student 
Jessica remained seated 
Katherine didn t take
our HIP class 
Why did she intervene 
And why didn t the
HIP student get up to help 
Katherine why do you
think you were first 
I m Greek and Italian 
so 
You re not afraid
to step in 
Jessica you ve been
through a program called HIP 
Did you think
about that during this 
Yes a lot 
I wanted to stand up 
I have really
pretty bad anxiety 
I am not a very
confrontational person 
Clearly the hero training class
was not the only factor
at work here 
We ran the test
several more times
with a mixed bag of results 
HIP students who helped 
She went looking for help 
HIP students
who did nothing 
and non HIP students
who acted heroically 
I m going to just ask him
if he wants some water 
 Elle 
She s doing it 
 What s he doing here 
 He s moving All right 
Is he gonna secretly
give Barry water 
Yes thank you 
Our last subject
of the day Ruben 
did not take the HIP class 
and we decided to make
taking heroic action
as difficult for him
We instructed
our bystander actors
not to react
to the elder abuse
or encourage Ruben
in any way 
 Barry I didn t have
enough water 
We just got here Barry 
 I know but I m thirsty 
 Could you stop complaining 
Just stop complaining 
I just need some water 
that s all I need 
Just a little bit of water 
 Michael He s got
this piercing look 
He s clearly paying
attention but there s
just no emotion there 
Yeah and he s getting no
feedback from the rest of the
group 
 Lisa You re making a scene
for no reason 
Hey leave that alone 
Leave that alone 
I just want some water 
I just want a little
bit of water 
Just Fine Just relax 
 Elle Despite
the remarkable
social cost
of getting up
in such a disaffected
group of people 
he did it 
If you don t want
to share the water 
I can give him my water 
That s fine 
 Is that okay 
Personally if you
were taking care of
my parent like that 
there would be definitely some
lawsuits cause that s not the
way you treat somebody 
With no training
and no support from the group 
Ruben chose to be a hero 
If I don t take action 
then nobody else will 
And I was like I wish
I would have stood up sooner 
Now I feel like in the future 
if I were to have
a situation like this 
I wouldn t even think twice 
Scientists have
studied heroism 
 and one thing
they have found
is that Hispanic and black males
are the most likely
to intervene 
Makes sense Maybe
because of the background
we come from as a minority 
we have to defend ourselves 
And I think it s a subconscious
thing that we do 
I m just shocked right now 
With flying colors 
might I add 
When it came to being a hero 
we found that the HIP class
could only help
to a certain extent 
and individual background
played a vital role 
So can heroic behavior
be taught 
or does it really
boil down to personality 
Ideally an educational
program like ours
should transcend
personality differences 
But practice makes perfect 
The key to heroism is
starting with very little steps 
try to do a good deed
of kindness 
and be willing to make
a bigger step 
We had a very small sample
size in our demonstration 
but we found that people
of color
were much more likely
to take action Why 
If you re
a minority person 
the system is
usually your enemy 
so you can t say Well 
the police will help 
or the government will help
or the landlord will help 
so it s me or no one 
And so you re just
more sensitive to
people in need 
Not all heroes are the same 
The wisest course of action
won t be the same
for any two people 
but making it a habit
to look for opportunities
to be compassionate 
and stepping back to see
and consider
all available options
can be learned 
It s a skill
exercised like a muscle 
by repetition 
You don t have to wear
a cape to be a hero 
but if you want to 
that s okay 
And as always 
 thanks for watching 
﻿ We live in a universe
where statistically
disorder is king 
As time moves forward 
things fall apart 
Stars burn out 
Energy spreads out 
Entropy conquers all 
But humans life fights
that trend 
We build things 
We organize things 
We add information 
So why is that we love
destroying things 
 shouts 
Exploding fireworks 
Fights and crashes 
Even popping bubble wrap 
Ugh 
Tiny cute things can make us
want to just squeeze em
to death 
The power to destroy
is a delicious one 
Even just holding this here 
knowing I can drop it 
I am in control 
I can exert my will in a
dramatic and irreversible way 
Ready 
Beautiful 
Why does that feel so good
to do 
or even just watch 
For me throwing it to its death
was almost relaxing 
like I feel calmer now
after being destructive 
like I ve vented
some pent up energy 
Or anger 
Why do we like breakings things
when we re angry 
There s a growing trend
of businesses
anger rooms that are popping up
in places
like Texas and Toronto 
People pay to visit
these anger rooms
and let off steam by smashing
mock ups of workplaces 
kitchens and more 
Catharsis Theory proposes
that such acts of destruction
reduce our anger 
But do they 
Sometimes but sometimes
they don t 
This is what makes studying
the mind so difficult 
Researchers are still looking
into the specifics
and the variables involved 
and I want to see firsthand
and in person what it s like
when people get angry
and then break things 
Will then be more or less
violent afterwards 
To demonstrate
Catharsis Theory 
we set up our own anger room
to see whether or not breaking
things will help calm down
some angry people 
Our subjects think
they re participating
in a study about opposing
political views 
so we ve asked them to write
an essay
on different polarizing topics 
 Come in 
 Kashona Hi 
How are you 
 Hi Michael 
 It s nice to meet you 
I was just with your
co participant Clint 
He s in another room 
I m gonna give your essay
to Clint 
and he s gonna critique it 
and you re going
to critique his 
 Okay thank you 
 See you soon 
 He wrote a lot 
I didn t write that much 
 Each of our subjects
has been paired with a man
named Clint 
and they will be critiquing
each other s essays 
 Police officers have
a very difficult job 
They have to protect us mainly
from people of color 
 The thing is 
I m actually Clint 
Overblown un American 
Get over it 
My job 
or rather Clint s job 
is to make our subjects mad
so they can test
our anger room 
You should be ashamed 
 You deserve what s coming
to you 
What a asshole 
Ha 
Changed it to black 
That s better 
Oops 
 Okay Kashona 
I m back 
And you were with Clint 
 Let s go through what he wrote
just quickly 
 He wrote 
 Did I put that that way 
 No you didn t 
 Did you turn it around 
 I did turn it around 
He seems like a bigot
or somebody 
I didn t want to keep looking
at his face 
 He s responded to
your essay there 
 We can t tell people where
to go to eat for lunch 
what car to drive 
like that just really
irritates me 
 This is a person that is
making arguments
that are not based in
any fact 
 He s clearly someone
who thinks
that the people who are on
social programs
are lazy 
 I was like 
What the bleep 
 Getting fired up mother 
ooh I m getting fired up 
 It s disgusting 
 I got an F plus 
Oh I hope I don t see him
in the hallway 
He s a dick 
and that is why he is part
of the reason
why our country bleep sucks
Because he s stupid 
 Well I think that
was pretty effective 
We ve got a lot of angry people
on our hands 
so will demolishing things
calm them down
or will acts of destruction
throw fuel on the fire 
Let s explore Catharsis Theory
with an expert 
 The modern view of catharsis
is that by acting out
we release sort of like
a pressure valve
and that releases that energy
in order for us to sort of
build up again
and handle everyday distress 
 People who are angry
and aggressive
who then act that out what
would they feel afterwards 
 What many studies have found
is that it s a short lived
release 
and it feels good it feels
really good to release 
but what happens
in the brain is 
the brain enjoys that 
There s really a reward to
build up that pressure again
and then release it again 
It s a temporary fix 
as far as we know 
 I didn t realize
it was so complicated
and still being researched 
I thought it was
black and white 
It was you do this 
and you release the emotion
and it s gone 
 Yeah not as much 
We don t have this
perfect definition
of catharsis 
where everybody agrees 
here s how it works 
here s how it ends up 
 Well let s see if catharsis
Now that Clint has sufficiently
angered all of our subjects 
 He s more like a bleep 
pussy as far as I m concerned 
 It s time to put
Catharsis Theory to the test 
Some subjects will be allowed
to actively take out
their anger
on all of these beautiful
art objects 
You have completely free reign
to break anything in this room 
Other subjects are instructed
to sit in the room passively 
I want you to reflect on
the essay the arguments 
the critiques 
and also on the objects
 Am I going to meet Clint
or not 
 No you are not 
 That s not part of this study 
 Okay got you 
 Wil these subjects
feel less angry
after their violent acts
of destruction 
Only one way to find out 
 rock music 
 elevator music 
When we are angry 
the body s adrenal glands
release cortisol
and adrenaline 
readying the body and mind
for fight mode 
 But Catharsis Theory
hypothesizes
that letting it out relieves
feelings of aggression 
 crack 
Will these subjects feel less
angry after their violent acts
 Okay I m done 
 Before we move on
to the final step
of our anger room
demonstration 
maybe we can gain insight
from someone who makes
a living by hitting 
Not objects but other people 
Mark Smith aka Rhino 
is a champion bodybuilder 
boxer 
and UK gladiator
who knows a thing or two
about how to destroy
an opponent 
So when you re going into
a fight 
you know that you re going
to get hurt 
 You know that you re going
hurt someone else 
How do you psych yourself up
to be good at that 
 When you get into a fight 
you want to stick to
your game plan 
stay focused and be relaxed 
 Relaxed 
Because I would have thought
you d want to go in angry 
 No because if you go in
too angry 
all you re doing is 
and you re not thinking
straight 
it turns into like 
a school brawl 
It s a very tactical game 
 The eye of the tiger 
like Rocky 
 But this is fascinating to me 
because you would think that to
physically outfight someone 
in nature we would have evolved
to run off of angry and fear 
 That s like two lions 
I agree with you there 
Two lions attack and go
full out don t they 
There s no pace in that fight
whatsoever 
like animals but you have to
know when to be an animal
and at what point in the fight 
Bang 
 But like so it s point in 
 I m a very jumpy 
flinchy person 
 It s knowing when to pull
the trigger 
 If you ever find yourself
angry in your real life 
do you find it helpful to punch
a punching bag 
 Definitely 
I will get angry like 
I m on the phone
with my bank and I might think
slamming a door
or just hanging up and throwing
my phone on the bed 
 No don t throw your phone 
and don t slam doors 
 Just come and exercise
and hit the bag 
you ll feel so much better 
 What s the difference though 
They re both like 
active things 
 Well you re not doing
something spontaneous
and acting on impulse 
 growls 
It s premeditated 
You know you re gonna go Okay 
I m gonna pack my bag 
I m gonna go to the gym 
I ll be releasing endorphins 
You ll feel more relaxed
and you ll be able to assess
the bank manager who s been
irritating you
for the last hour 
 Can I can I try hitting
some things 
You can try hitting me 
 Can I really 
Are you gonna hit back 
 I will 
I will let you know I m there 
Awesome 
Do I look scary 
Is Rhino correct that
violent acts of rage
won t calm you down 
But the controlled aggression
used in boxing
will actually relax you 
I guess I m about to find out 
 Yes like that 
No no 
 groaning 
 Well done 
 I came out of the fight
having learned two things 
One I m a wimp 
And two Rhino was right 
when physical violence
is channeled
in an organized sport
like boxing 
it can actually reduce feelings
of aggression 
I had this weird combination
of feelings 
As tired as I am 
 I m very amped up 
 So now you feel it 
I don t feel aggressive 
 You feel relaxed 
 I wouldn t say
I m relaxed here 
I would just say
I m clearer here 
and I feel more in control 
 Eye of the tiger Rock 
 Yeah well maybe it s the eye
of the kitten 
who is in a bad mood 
but man that was great 
It s time for the final part of
our anger room demonstration 
All of our subjects
will be taking part
in what they think
is a reflex test
against their opponent Clint 
In reality of course 
there is no Client 
and what we re really
is the Catharsis Theory 
Have our subjects levels
of anger been affected
according to whether
they committed
violent acts of destruction 
Or not 
Stage three is going to be
testing
how your reflexes are working
at this very moment 
So this right here is
a static electricity generator
that is going to provide
a little bit of a shock 
We re putting one on Clint
as well 
and he s in another room 
but you both have
the same setup 
Once our subjects are fitted
with the shock bracelet 
they re introduced to
the test s control panel 
Look at this 
 Yeah it s very simplified 
but that really helps keep
the variables low 
So both you and Clint will be
competing in a bit of a game 
The yellow light is going to
come on at some point 
and as soon as you see it
come on 
hit that orange button 
And if you hit this button
before Clint does 
you ll see the green light
come on 
And that will mean that you won 
And Clint needs to receive
a small shock okay 
And you can set this to a level
of your choosing 
 So okay 
Light goes on 
if I hit this 
the green one comes and then
I m allowed
to work this contraption 
 Which controls how
high the voltage and for how
long the voltage 
 If however Clint pushes
the button before you do 
the red light will come on 
indicating 
 My red light and I m about
to get it 
 That you ll get a shock yeah 
We ll get a sense of our
subjects level of anger
by how they respond to the
chance to administer pain
to Clint 
Remember this subject just sat
in the anger room passively 
 Did I get him 
Oh all right 
 The green light means
our subject wins 
How hard will he shock Clint 
 I m gonna give you a little
low one buddy 
Just a kiss 
Ah got me 
 The red light means
Clint won 
How will our subject respond
to getting shocked 
 static buzz 
 Ah 
You son of a bitch 
 Not only does this subject
not seem angry he s actually
enjoying the game 
How about that 
I m not gonna harm you man 
Gave ya a little low one 
 He actually seems
relatively calm 
Will our other passive subject
follow suit 
Clint gave her a painful shock 
Let s see how strongly
she retaliates 
Even after getting a shock
from Clint 
this subject is still hesitant
to give him a shock in return 
 over PA 
Okay Clint and Drea 
this is just a reminder
that you are 
you are allowed to change
that dial
to what you think would be
appropriate 
 Yeah I just don t want to 
like hurt him or anything 
I m just gonna keep it at low 
 So the angry subjects
who sat passively
seemed to have calmed down 
Now it s time to check on the
subjects who acted violently
in the anger room 
Did letting out all of
that aggression
relieve their anger 
The experiment will begin now 
 Take it take it take it 
 Kashona 
That s that s fine 
What level is your dial at 
Low 
 He cranked that all the way up
and he s laying on that button 
This subject was one of
the most aggressive people
in the anger room 
but that doesn t seem to have
calmed him down 
 Among our subjects 
it seems that those
who physically vented
their anger are still
pretty angry
compared to that subjects
who sat quietly 
 So at least in this case 
catharsis therapy
was not effective 
In fact in some cases 
the subject seems even angrier 
 Ow bleep 
That s too hard 
You bleep dick 
Why don t you come in here and
 bleep talk to me in person 
Oh my God 
 We re all familiar with
the concept of rubbernecking 
It s hard to look away from
a car crash 
 But why 
There are surely a myriad
of reasons 
but one may be that at
a primitive level 
witnessing danger allows us
to learn and prepare for it 
Activities where danger
and destruction are likely
are exciting 
Starting in our childhood 
physical aggression
is encouraged 
even in games 
Take a piñata for example 
As a special birthday treat 
we are told to beat up
an effigy with a baseball bat 
And when we hit it hard enough 
we are rewarded with candy 
What parts of a child s urge
to destroy are innate
versus learned 
Well there is a groundbreaking
experiment
that shed light on this 
In Albert Bandura
conducted a famous
and controversial study
called the Bobo Doll Experiment 
He had adults act violently
to an inflatable clown doll
in the presence of children 
Then left the children alone
with the same doll
to see if they would mimic
the destructive behavior
they d observed 
Disturbingly the children
did indeed copy the adults 
and lashed out at the doll 
often getting very creative
with their aggression
and destruction 
Aggression comes in many
unexpected forms 
Why is it so hard to resist
popping bubbles in bubble wrap 
for instance 
Do we like the sound 
The destruction 
Or both 
It s like we re naturally drawn
to destroying
these harmless plastic bubbles
of air 
Destructive tendencies seem
to be so engrained in us
that we even respond
to positive stimulation
with urges to destroy 
One of the strangest things
about destruction
is how people want to hug things
to death 
especially things that are
extremely cute 
like a puppy 
We don t know exactly why
this is 
but there is a study
that demonstrates the effect
by using bubble wrap
and our desire
to pop these bubbles 
 popping 
Can sweet adorable stimuli
really insight
aggressive behavior 
We re about to find out 
in our focus test 
 Please make yourself
comfortable 
 We ve recruited subjects
who think
they re taking part
in a motor skills test 
 Are you familiar with
this product 
 Have you popped the bubbles
in bubble wrap before 
 But really what we re testing
is their aggressive response
to cute stimuli 
 So you will be viewing
a montage of images 
Please pop bubbles
in the bubble wrap 
You may pop as many or as few
as you like 
Just be sure to start
when the images begin
and stop when the images end 
 Popping bubbles is like
squeezing a stress ball 
It s a great way
to express aggression 
The question is will
the subjects pop more bubbles
when watching neutral images
or cute ones 
First we showed our subjects
these basic landscapes 
which are not designed to
elicit an emotional response 
 pop 
And we tallied the total number
of bubbles popped 
 Okay great 
I ll take those 
All right we re gonna do
part two 
where you ll be viewing
another set of images 
 We also showed them images
of 
puppies 
 playful piano music 
Oh look at that one 
Don t you just want to hug it
and squeeze it to 
well okay you get the point 
To keep things even 
half of the subjects viewed
the landscapes first
and half viewed the puppies
first 
But either way they seemed
to pop a lot more bubbles
while watching the puppies 
Except for this guy 
So called cute aggression
is a universal
psychological phenomenon 
Researchers believe
the brain s response
to both cuteness and aggression
results in the release
of dopamine
implicated in the reward
and pleasure 
but if we are unable to
physically touch cute stimuli 
the desire to do so
can be regulated
by substituting aggressive
physical behavior 
Will our results reflect
this theory 
 How did you feel
about the images that you saw 
 They were cool 
 How did you feel about
the puppies 
 I love them 
 They were very tiny
and adorable 
And I wanted to hug them 
 And how did you feel about
popping the bubble wrap 
 I felt like I wanted to
play with the dogs or 
I wanted to play with the bubble
wrap with the dogs 
 In our simple test our
subjects popped an average
of more bubbles while
watching cute puppies 
boring landscapes 
 So was the bubble wrap
a stand in for the puppies 
 In fact the majority
of our subjects
popped more bubbles
while watching puppies 
But not this guy 
Remember him 
 So how did you feel about
seeing the dog pictures 
 Um I ve always been more
of a cat person 
 It seems sometimes cuteness
is a matter of perspective 
Our relationship with
destruction is not a simple one 
It can release endorphins
and relax our minds 
It can amp us up and make us
even more aggressive 
It can even help us regulate
our emotional reactions
to cute things 
Destruction can be useful 
it can be dangerous 
and it can be a lot of fun 
﻿The nervous system
is fundamentally electric 
When we move our arm 
it moves because a signal
has been sent to the muscle
that controls it 
and that message
is made of charged atoms
moving in and out
of nerve cells 
It s electricity 
Now because the brain
is electric 
we could also use
electricity to record
what the brain is doing
or bypass it entirely 
 and control a body 
 beep 
That means that
we could use our minds
to move other people s bodies 
restore movement to people
who are paralyzed 
feel through an artificial hand
as if it was our own 
and even read people s minds 
Shocking 
Even though electricity
wasn t really understood
until the s 
its ability
to influence the body
had been known since at least
ancient Roman times 
when respected physician
Scribonius Largus
wrote about a man
who accidentally stepped
on an electric fish
and was suddenly relieved
of gout pain 
Scribonius did some experiments
and found that you could put
an electric fish
on your head
and relieve headaches 
In 
centuries later 
Italian physicist
Giovanni Aldini
discovered he could make
people s muscles move
with electricity 
He amazed the European world
by using electricity
to animate the corpse
of an executed criminal 
The corpse opened its eyes
and even seemed to sit up 
But Aldini wasn t just
trying to shock people 
He was showing the world
that neurons 
the cells that control both
our thoughts and our movements 
operate through electricity 
Imagine bypassing
a person s brain
so as to control their body 
Now normally
when you move your body 
your brain sends
electrical signals
through nerves 
But if we could use electrodes
to send those signals 
we could control
a person s body
without needing their brain
to be involved 
We could control them
with a remote control 
and that s what
we are about to do today
with cockroaches 
I m here with Tim Marzullo
from Backyard Brains 
and Tim you brought
some cockroaches 
 Tim Yes Michael 
cockroaches use their antenna
to sense their environment
and move around 
and we re going to try
to trick the cockroach
and control
its movement
for a number
of minutes 
Trick it how do we trick it 
We are going to do a surgery
on the cockroach
where we re going to hijack
the nervous system
to send electrical impulses
to their antenna 
well let s get to it 
 Tim Let s do it 
 Michael I ve brought with me
today a state of the art
cockroach operating room 
Now how do you do surgery
on a cockroach 
We have a jar of ice water 
and to induce anesthesia
we are going to put
the cockroaches
in the ice water
and their nervous system
will stop firing
electrical impulses 
We ll notice after a minute
or two they ll stop moving 
 Michael Once the roaches
were anesthetized 
they were ready
for surgery 
 Tim All right 
so then now what we re gonna do
is attach the electrodes 
So here we have
the little connector 
It has three wires 
It has a ground wire 
and it has a wire
for the left antenna
and the right antenna 
I m going to put
a little bead of Superglue
on the cockroach right here 
and then I m just gonna
stick the electrode
on the cockroach s head 
 Michael Next 
we inserted the ground wire
into the flight muscle
of the wing 
 Tim There you go 
 Michael Cool 
 Tim I put the wire
in the back 
The remaining two wires
get inserted
into the antenna 
 Tim Now I m just
gonna snip the antenna
right there and we 
 Michael And now because
it s a hollow tube 
 we can stick
the wire in 
 Tim So now 
what I m gonna do
is I m just gonna insert it
 All right 
 Michael Got it wow 
 Tim And he s ready
for the left antenna 
There we go 
It went right in there 
I ll put the cockroach
right back in the ice water 
Now it s worth pointing out
what this does to them
and to their quality of life 
 Tim Yeah after the surgery
I m gonna take them back
to their homes 
snip the wires 
and these cockroaches
will then be retired 
 Michael And the antenna
will grow back 
 Tim Yes and I will return
them to our reproducing colony 
and they ll live happy
cockroach lives
after the show 
 Michael Fantastic 
 Tim All right 
 So now we re ready to go 
 Michael Wonderful 
Our cyber roach
was now neurologically wired
for external control 
 Michael This is
a state of the art
roach racetrack 
Tim and I are about
to take some robo roaches
for a test drive 
But first Tim 
I wanna see how
an ordinary roach
moves around
and uses its antenna 
 Tim So let s just see
where this guy goes 
He wants to explore my hand 
and then oh wow 
 Racin away 
And you can you see
he s hugging that wall 
You can see he keeps tapping
the wall and moving along 
He s not in the middle
of the road 
 he s on the edge of it 
As we know 
roaches use their antennas
to explore their surroundings
and locate food and shelter 
When no walls or obstacles
were sensed 
the roaches felt free
to move around at will 
 Hey guys 
 Tim Hey whoa whoa 
 Michael follow the rules 
It was time to test drive
our robo roach 
 Michael So this
is the battery 
along with
the Bluetooth device 
 Tim And I m just gonna plug
them in right now 
 Michael We re talking
about actual voltages 
 Tim Yes because
we are talking to the nerves
in a language that
the nerves understand 
 Michael Tim has built an app
that communicates
to the electrode
on the roach s back 
When we swipe right 
the electrode sends a signal
to the roach s left antenna 
stimulating the sensation
of an obstacle
on its left
which causes the roach
to move right and vice versa 
Which way should we go 
left or right 
I think we should go left 
Left Whoa 
 Tim Okay well that s 
 Michael Doing donuts 
All right that was
a little bit too high 
 Michael We adjusted
the intensity of the signal
to find the optimal setting 
All right now I m gonna try
to get him to turn right 
go back through the factory 
 Tim Oh 
 Michael Good job 
 Tim Okay very good 
Now he doesn t know
if there s a road 
so I m gonna have to tell him
to kind of keep going
 to the right good 
 Michael 
Yeah good come here 
 All right where is he 
Did he just he wants to go
to the hot air balloon 
He wants to go
to the hot air balloon 
but I would rather
he go to work
at the factory 
so I m gonna I m gonna 
He s like 
I ll go back to work 
 Michael I m gonna swipe left 
 Tim Okay 
 There good All right left 
 Tim Very good 
 Michael Now right 
 Tim Ooh All right 
 Michael Good 
 Michael All right 
watch this And turn right 
 Michael Good good good 
Turn right 
turns a little bit 
 Michael Turn right oh 
 Tim Oh you see
 he adapts over time 
 Michael He adapts over time 
So we are taking away
their autonomous control
of their body 
We re just causing
them to think
they should decide to move
one way or the other 
 Tim Yeah some people
used to be sort of scared
that we re on
the slippery slope
where I m gonna control
a whole humanity
with my electrical stimulation 
but you can see that
there s so many other sensory
signals that the cockroach
is receiving 
that we re competing with 
 So Tim this was very cool 
 Tim Uh huh 
 a little bit weird 
I didn t feel
totally comfortable
controlling
a living organism 
 But there s something here
that s that s really
important for the future
of understanding brains 
 Tim Sure 
we use this technology
in biomedical applications 
such as cochlear implants 
and deep brain stimulation
to treat Parkinson s 
But things such as
consciousness and attention
and will are currently
really at the cutting edge
of neuroscience research 
How do you
make decisions 
The wonderful thing
about uh 
neuroscience is
that it s wide open 
In the very near future 
cyber cockroaches
could actually save lives 
Researchers at Texas A M
and North Carolina
State University
are developing
a groundbreaking use
for robo roaches in search
and rescue missions 
Instead of installing wires
in the roach s antennae 
they re implanting receptors
in the bug s
actual nervous systems
to insure
a longer term effect 
The plan is to release
a swarm of robo roaches
into a disaster area
like a collapsed building 
As the roaches explore 
they ll send images
and data back to a computer
which creates a detailed D map
of the disaster zone 
If the cyber bugs stray
from the search area 
their nerves get stimulated
to steer them back in 
If a roach detects a survivor 
a signal is sent back
with the victim s location 
While a real world test
has not been done yet 
scientists hope to do so
within the next years 
Meanwhile the same technology
used to cyber hack cockroaches
can also be used on humans 
Now Tim 
when I move my arm 
my brain is sending
to my muscles
and they respond to that 
and they contract 
and they release 
But you are about
to use a battery
to electrically
stimulate my muscles 
Sure sure 
 Michael A human s
nervous system can be hacked
with no surgery required 
Tim attached electrodes
to my forearm 
which communicated
via Bluetooth
to an app on his iPad 
 Tim So I m gonna amplify
the signals
of your muscle activity 
So every time a neuron
talks to the muscle 
the muscle fires
an electrical impulse
like the neurons 
So we can see
these electrical impulses
right here 
So what I want you to do
 is contract 
 Michael grunts Oh yeah 
so there you go 
you can see the impulses
 occurring in your 
 Watch this 
 Tim So that whoosh
is the sound
of many muscle
fibers firing 
 Michael Many many 
 firing action potentials
because neurons are synapsing
on those muscles
when you are deciding
to move your body 
Let me passively move
your hand 
We don t see that much activity 
maybe some stretch activity 
but now resist me 
 Now there s no movement 
 Michael Wow 
but we re seeing
electrical activity
because it s due
to contraction 
So what s cool
about this
is that because
you are making
voluntary movements
with your brain 
we can exploit these
muscle contractions
and use it
to control robotics 
 Michael Okay so Tim 
this is all really cool 
but the real reason
I invited you here today
and told you to bring
all of this is that
I want to control
another human Alie 
 Hi Michael 
 Thanks for coming 
So Alie you might be
a little apprehensive now
after hearing
what I just said but 
Yeah yeah I heard you 
This is for science 
and it s gonna go both ways 
I m gonna let you control
my arm as well You ready 
Okay Wait I m going
first though 
You re gonna go first 
I think that s important yes 
 For 
 For randomization 
 Alie Okay 
 I flipped a coin earlier
that no one saw 
but it happened 
Alie Ward
from the Ologies podcast
was brave enough to let me test
how the brain sends signals
to the body 
in this case
my brain sending signals
to move her body 
And we ve placed
a screen between us
so she can t see
when I make a move
that sends the signal 
So Michael 
Okay Should I contract
like softly or firmly 
 Just go all the way
like that yes 
 All the way 
 Okay here we go 
 Did you feel anything 
 Not yet no 
 I m not strong enough 
 Okay I m gonna turn it up
 a little bit okay 
 Alie Okay yeah 
It feels like pins and needles
 Tim Okay You re at two 
I m gonna turn up to four okay 
 Alie All right 
Now contract 
Ah 
That was really really 
really weird 
 Tim Contract 
 Oh that s really weird 
 This is really weird 
Oh that s I d 
I m still not over that 
It feels like uh 
I m a marionette
and there s just strings
being tugged 
 Michael For the sake
of science it was only fair
that I give Alie a turn
at the controls 
But I also wanted to know
what it was like
to have someone
control my movements 
All right now while
Alie controls my body 
I thought it would be nice
to maybe enjoy some hot 
bright red tomato soup
and a nice glass
of grape juice 
I might even do some writing 
 scoffs multitasking 
So um can we try out
the strength 
uh just like get
a bit of a sense
 of what s gonna happen to me 
So I ll put it
really low at a two 
 Michael Good yeah 
And uh okay 
now contract Alie 
 Ah okay yup I felt it 
 Contract again 
 I felt 
 Okay Did you feel that 
 Tim All right now 
I m gonna turn it up
to a four 
now contract 
 Yup 
That s um 
that s not me moving my arm 
Or the rest of your
entire body responds 
 Michael Well yeah 
I m a jumpy person 
so you re gonna get
a lot more out of me 
 Michael Now please
don t control me
while I just take a nice 
relaxing sip of 
 Alie chuckles 
 Tim I ll turn it up
to five and a half 
 Michael Okay I m just
gonna take a nice little 
uh taste of this soup 
I love it chuckles 
The meanest part is that
this is very lukewarm soup 
All right Now just let me
please eat in peace 
 I m sorry 
I m gonna take a break
and write something 
I ll leave you alone 
I ll leave you alone 
 groans 
I m try 
I can resist it but 
Like the cockroaches 
my body was learning
to adapt to the signal 
To science 
That s the beauty
of electrophysiology 
Of course the fact that our
neurons
work through electricity
means that we can also
record from them 
and that has amazing
medical applications 
The electroencephalogram 
or EEG 
came about in the s 
allowing doctors to see
some of the brain s
as visible brain waves 
But by the s 
scientists realized
that for some tasks 
like the dream of allowing
paralyzed patients
to move a robotic arm 
you need a much richer
brain signal 
That s because moving an arm
requires a lot of information 
You need information
for how to move your upper arm 
your forearm your hand 
your fingers 
all through D space 
EEG just doesn t carry enough
information to do that 
since the electrical signals
it picks up
get distorted
after they make their way
through our skull and skin 
So if you wanted to control
a prosthetic limb
with just your mind 
researchers realized
you d need to record
directly from the brain 
And in 
scientists finally
did just that 
They implanted an electrode
in the brain
of a paralyzed human
for the very first time 
And since that
first test patient 
several paralyzed patients
have received brain implants
that allow them
to control robotic arms
with their minds 
As our understanding
of the brain grows
and our computers get better
at decoding signals
from the brain 
these patients are gaining
finer and finer control
over these robotic arms 
Recently science has taken
a big leap forward
from allowing
to control robotic limbs
to giving them control
of their own limbs 
I traveled
to Ohio State University
to meet one of those patients 
Ian Burkhart 
At while vacationing
with friends 
Ian dove into a wave
at the beach
and broke his neck
on the sandy floor 
leaving him paralyzed
from the chest down 
 Ian I knew as soon as I hit
that I was paralyzed 
And I was floating
face down in the water
 and could not get up 
 Could you 
 Ian I couldn t move
anything at all 
You go from being 
and independent 
living on your own
in college to now 
I need help doing everything
from eating to going
to the bathroom 
sitting up 
getting into my wheelchair 
I can move my shoulders
pretty well 
can move my biceps
that allow me
to move my arms
but nothing
from my biceps down 
 Michael The doctors
at Ohio State had approached
Ian about a revolutionary
experimental treatment
developed by Battelle 
a research
and development firm
using cutting edge technology
called NeuroLife 
They wanted to implant a chip
in Ian s motor cortex 
which would allow him
to move his hand again
while he was connected
to a computer in the lab 
I was invited
to the Wexner Medical Center
at Ohio State University
to meet the researchers
and witness this cutting edge
work in action 
 Sam So first we re gonna plug
Ian into the system 
 Ian The piece uh is
protruding from my skull as 
 Ian reference 
that s the pedestal 
It s under
a little protective cap 
um but it s there 
and it leads to some wires
that go to the actual
microchip array
that s on the surface
 Michael Pushed into
the actual organ of the brain 
 Ian Exactly 
The microchip in Ian s head
detects the blood flow
and electrical impulses
of his brain
that are associated
with causing movement 
 Sam 
So this is the actual chip 
It sits on the surface
of his brain 
 Michael Wow 
Ian s brain is connected
to software
that reads and analyzes
his brain activity 
So this is a live look
at Ian s motor cortex 
 Marcie Yes 
So if you think about
moving your arm 
we should see more activity
 or a different pattern 
 Ian Yeah 
At the start of the session 
in order to calibrate
the decoder with his brain 
Ian is prompted
to think about
moving his hand
by watching images
of hand movements 
 Ian You ll see
my computer prompt me
and as it prompts me
to do that 
that s what
I m thinking about 
What do you mean
think about 
 Ian Just as much
as I can think about
 imagining that movement 
As Ian s brain thinks
about moving his hand 
 Sam Okay Ian are you ready 
 its electrical signals
are detected by the chip
and sent to the decoder 
Then we take
that information
and we associate it
with a hand closed 
So now the decoder
can recognize
if he s thinking
that same thing again 
the decoder sends a signal
to a device that can control
Ian s muscle movement 
This special sleeve
on Ian s arm
contains a hundred
and thirty electrodes 
which stimulate the muscles
in his forearm
to produce the specific
movements
that his brain
is thinking about 
such as closing his hand
or moving his thumb 
Now it was time to see Ian
move his paralyzed hand
with his thoughts 
 Sam So Ian if you re ready
for this next one 
 Ian Yup 
 I m gonna count you down 
 Michael Whoa 
 Marcie So 
that was the decoder 
Decoding his thoughts 
 Decoding his thoughts 
 Marcie Ian was in control
of the movements 
 Michael Nice work 
Already Ian s achievements
go far beyond
closing his hand 
With the help of this
cutting edge technology 
he can use
his own paralyzed hand
to do a number
of fine motor tasks
from everyday movements
to playing Guitar Hero 
How many other people
are like Ian 
Currently in the world 
maybe five 
 Michael Ian continues
to gain more independence
outside the lab as well 
Do people
ever drive with you
and get nervous like 
Oh my gosh 
well clearly
this is dangerous 
 Ian I think
if everyone else
that was driving
along in the road knew
I have no use of my hands
going miles an hour
down the freeway 
they may not like that 
But they ve they have
nothing to worry about 
 Ian Right yeah 
and I m probably safer
because I can t take
my hands off the wheel
 to get on my cell phone and 
 Right Yup 
You re not fiddling
with the radio and 
Yeah that I shouldn t be
doing while I m driving 
 Michael Ian s progress
was truly inspiring 
and this was only
the beginning for him 
What are your hopes
for the future for yourself 
 Ian Hopefully 
I can upgrade
to the next version
and you know 
have more capabilities
and be able to do things
a lot easier 
In the long term I hope
that this can be a device
that people just use 
You have someone
who has a spinal cord injury
and they can just continue
right where they left off 
I think you know 
the work that we re doing
is something that has
never been done before
and it s really exciting to be
on that cutting edge 
Restoring movement
is one thing 
but what about feeling 
sensation 
We feel with our skin
because of signals
sent to the somatosensory
cortex of our brain 
By putting sensors
in robotic fingers
connected to implants
in a person s
somatosensory cortex 
researchers
at the University of Pittsburgh
have enabled Nathan Copeland
to feel
through a robotic hand 
Nathan underwent
brain surgery
to receive two implants 
one in his motor cortex
to control a robotic arm
and a second implant
over his somatosensory cortex 
This second implant
stimulates his brain
and the pattern
of stimulation depends
on what part
of the robot hand is touched 
So if you touch the robot
on a specific finger 
then the part of Nathan s
somatosensory cortex
that normally responds
to that finger
get stimulated 
 Nathan Pinky 
Uh middle 
 Michael His brain interprets
that as touch 
Nathan and Ian s
remarkable achievements
have been aided
by their ability
to communicate
with the researchers involved 
But what can be done
for people
who are not only
unable to move 
but also unable to speak 
Steve Kaplan was an active
 year old computer programmer
dating Laurie 
a horse wrangler
for the rodeo 
But that all changed
a year ago
when he suffered
a massive stroke
leaving him
in a vegetative state 
unable to move or speak 
Doctors initially declared
Steve brain dead 
However inside his body
he was fully conscious 
but unable to tell them so 
It wasn t
until a nurse noticed
that Steve s eye movements
were intentional
that he was diagnosed
with locked in syndrome 
a condition which robs
people of everything
but their mind 
While a normal brain
receives electrical signals
from the senses and sends
signals back to them 
the stroke prevented
the electrical signals
from leaving Steve s brain 
Over the last year 
of physical therapists 
Steve has regained
some very minor
range of motion in his neck 
I sat down with Steve
and his now wife Laurie
to learn more about
locked in syndrome 
Steve Laurie hello 
Although he s still
unable to speak 
thanks to new scientific
developments 
Steve can communicate
with the outside world
using a computer 
 computer male voice 
Hello Michael 
Nice to meet you Steve 
And nice
to meet you Laurie 
for giving us some time 
Tell me how Steve started
being able to communicate 
 Laurie Well you know 
I asked a lot of questions
about locked in syndrome
when they explained
what it was 
and there wasn t
a lot of answers 
 Laurie At the beginning 
he would blink once for yes
and twice for no 
And that was the first parts
of the communication 
And then they
gave us a board 
and I went
through the ABCs 
and he would close his eyes
when I got to what he wanted 
I d write it down 
and that s how it began 
 Michael As you could imagine 
Laurie and Steve s
first method of communicating
was a slow
and painstaking process 
But just months later 
an engineer working to help
locked in patients
built Steve a machine
that tracks his eye movements 
As Steve looks at different
letters on a screen 
the machine translates
where he s looking
into synthesized
audible speech 
I want to recover 
 Michael Although
there s still a slight delay
in communication
as Steve scans
the letters on the screen 
this method is much more fluid
and significantly faster 
The computer helps me
communicate
 Michael Yeah 
You can write with your eyes 
 Laurie 
This thing s amazing 
He can email 
he can text 
call me
if he needs something 
It s such a relief 
It does wonders 
It does wonders yes 
 Uh hmm chuckles 
 Michael And I could only
imagine how emotional
it would have been
to you to be able to look
and write a thing 
and then have it spoken 
And Laurie 
for you to hear
words coming from his mind 
from his heart 
especially
for the first time
 in a long time 
 Laurie Yes 
What was the first thing
you said Steve 
 computer male voice The first
message was happy birthday 
What a birthday present 
 Laurie laughs 
It really was 
 Michael Steve s progress
is remarkable 
and it would be
difficult to deny
the connection between
his new ability to communicate
and connect
with the incredible advances
he s made physically
over the last year 
 Look up at the ceiling 
 Look down at your thumbs 
 clears throat 
Look over at me 
your beautiful wife 
 Michael Laurie and Steve
hope that one day
Steve will make
a full recovery
from locked in syndrome 
Steve s eye tracking device
and so is his brain 
They re connected by the fact
that Steve can move his eyes 
But some locked in patients
can t even control
their eye movements 
They have what is known
as completely
For these patients 
the eye tracking technology
that helped Steve communicate
is useless 
But researchers in Europe
recently found a way
of allowing completely
using just their thoughts 
The researchers combined EEG
with near infrared
spectroscopy 
which can non invasively
measure blood flow
in the brain 
The patients were asked
simple yes or no questions
that the researchers
knew the answers to 
which allowed them
to train a machine to recognize
which brain signals meant yes
and which brain signals
meant no 
then asked the patients
a new set of questions
they knew the answer to 
and using just their thoughts 
the patients were able to give
the correct answers
to of the questions 
Now giving just
yes or no answers
may be limited 
but this technology is new 
All of this happened
just this year 
These rapid advancements 
thanks to the devotion
and effort of researchers
and subjects around the world 
are slowly but surely
chipping away
at the mysteries of the mind 
The better
we understand the mind 
the better
we ll be able to help
the millions of people
who struggle to do
what they want
because of psychological
or neurological conditions 
and ultimately the better
we ll understand ourselves 
﻿Someday I will die 
If I was offered
a longer life 
I would take that
in a second 
But how long is too long 
Is death something
I should deny forever 
or is death and the role
it plays in the universe
something I am better off
accepting 
I want to start by looking
at a particular way
death affects how we live
and treat one another 
Terror Management Theory
proposes that people
like you and me
manage the terror
of death s inevitability
by embracing cultural values 
That the more aware a person is
of their own mortality 
the more vehemently
they will enforce
their particular views
of the world onto others 
Created by social psychologists
Sheldon Solomon 
Jeff Greenberg
and Tom Pyszczynski 
Terror Management Theory 
or TMT 
suggests that often 
we are afraid of change
because we re afraid
of death 
Each one of us
has a worldview 
a set of beliefs 
customs and norms
we identify with
that can live on
after our physical bodies die 
TMT suggest that rises
in nationalism and prejudice
are correlated with rises
in the salience of mortality 
That is how present
the inevitability of death is
in people s minds 
Now this role that death plays
fascinates me 
and two of TMT s originators 
Jeff and Sheldon 
have agreed to work with me
on a pilot study
of Terror Management Theory
and real life reminders
What s your hypothesis today 
Well I think we re going
to hope for the participants
who are reminded
of their mortality
to be more punitive
in their assessments 
See what happens 
For our study 
we created a fake research
center 
staffed by actors 
and invited participants
to be a part
of what they were told
was a focus group
about the criminal justice
system 
During the actual study 
each group will hear a list
of several different crimes
that have been committed 
and will then be asked
to propose a punishment
for each offender
with a severity level
ranging from to 
with being the most lenient
and being
the most severe 
The control group will simply
enter the survey room
and be asked
to answer the questions 
The experimental group 
however 
will first be exposed
to reminders of their own
mortality
with strategically placed
posters in the lobby 
Also the questionnaires
they fill out
will include questions
about their own death 
Decades of TMT research
have shown that when presented
with violations
of common worldviews 
those who are more aware
of their own deaths
will recommend bigger
punishments
for the crimes presented 
But will our real life
reminders of death 
not just the survey questions
usually used 
make a difference 
Well first let s look
at the control participants 
 woman Well thank you
so much for being here 
Now I cannot
emphasize this enough 
There are no
right or wrong answers 
This is just about
your gut level reactions 
All right let s begin 
After raising millions
of dollars in grant money
to fund education
for needy children 
a fundraising manager
unhappy with this life
fled with all the money
and was arrested months later
in Tasmania 
where he was living
under a different name 
So least punishment 
three months in prison 
 is most severe 
ten years in prison 
Please answer now 
This is one that I think does
have worldviews on both sides 
That is a lot of s 
If our control group is
already maxing out like that 
well then our scale
has no room in that direction
to show any effect
of mortality salience 
Discovering issues like this 
learning how to better isolate
mortality salience s effect 
is exactly what a pilot test
is for 
Hey personal differences huh 
 woman An imposter
with no medical training
posed as a surgeon and bungled
a minor operation
to remove a child s tonsils 
The patient recovered fully
after additional treatment 
 is six months on probation 
 is ten years in prison 
 Sheldon 
If you are taking on the persona
of a doctor 
we would expect good behavior 
 woman The surgeon botched
the operation
and was found to be under
the influence of narcotics 
causing her to have permanent
hoarseness
and ruining her career 
A year old girl who had just
received her license
drove through a red light 
hitting another car
that was being driven
by a talented pianist 
A couple was taking their two
children to the playground
when they saw a woman
sunbathing nude 
There could be a gender gap 
We re also learning a lot about
the worldviews people have 
 Jeff 
An anti government protester
was arrested
for spray painting profanities
at the Lincoln Memorial
in Washington D C 
 hours 
Wow she went 
right away 
She s not a fan of authority
and rules 
Okay thank you so much
for your time 
We really appreciate it 
All right so here s the results
in a mathematical analysis 
These are averages per question 
These are the averages
and medians per participant 
 Jeff The s are great 
The s great 
But this is ground
for optimism at least 
 Michael was the max
sentencing value 
and our control group
gave an average of 
I m really happy with that
as a control group 
Absolutely 
Now our experimental groups 
Remember they will be seeing
posters that remind them
and will be asked
different questions
in their questionnaire 
For example 
The point is to prime
their mortality salience 
Let s see if this group
is more punitive
towards worldview
violations 
of dollars
in Tasmania 
 three months in prison 
 ten years in prison 
Okay he s thinking
Please hold up your answers 
Thank you so much 
 six months on probation 
 They are thinking a lot more 
 Sheldon Wow 
 Michael A 
I m pretty sure she knows
that is the highest 
We ll call it a 
It s funny to see
when people feel bold enough 
even though I m breaking
the bounds
and the rules of the task 
I really do appreciate the way
they clearly seem to be
taking a bit more time
 to deliberate 
Okay they can put
the papers down 
and tell them that we will be in
shortly 
Okay thank you so much 
We ve finished with this part
of the study 
So if you won t mind
hanging out for a moment 
and our researchers
will be in here in a moment
to ask you a couple questions 
 Michael Let s find out
if the reminders of mortality
we showed our experimental
group were salient enough 
Let me ask you about one thing 
Out in the waiting room 
did you all notice
the posters at all 
Yes they are all death related 
Okay All right 
 all laugh 
So we are looking into
something that s called
Terror Management Theory 
And it s the idea that your own
awareness of your mortality
can affect the behaviors
that you exhibit 
That we all manage the terror
that we feel
knowing that we are mortal 
by behaving in certain ways 
especially in ways that
reinforce our own worldviews 
Because we could kind of live on
through the societies
and cultures and identities
that we have today 
 Jeff Did any of you feel like
you were still thinking
a little bit about death
when you came in here 
I was definitely going
after people who transgressed
against my worldview 
to use your term 
 Yes I noticed that 
 I was definitely doing that 
So this was incredibly helpful 
 Jeff Yeah 
 Michael Thank you very much 
 Jeff Thanks so much 
I appreciate 
It looks like our experimental
stimuli were successful 
They were salient but didn t
cause the participants
to think they were related
to the study 
The control participants
averaged about 
The experimental participants
were close to 
if we round up 
So there s a slight tendency
for the experimental people
to be leaning in the direction
that we predicted 
But we re talking about
relatively inconsequential
That s right It just makes me
hungry to run more people 
And with the number that we had 
that s statistically
insignificant 
Do you think that we did
see any effects
of mortality salience today 
 Jeff I feel like the mortality
salient groups
tended to think a little
longer before responding 
Yeah me too 
And they seemed more thoughtful 
 They were really 
 They put more effort into it 
into trying to do
the right thing 
The difference was dramatic
enough that we picked up on it 
 Although our stimuli
might need to go through
more passes and more vetting 
we did find
an interesting difference
in the time it took
for our groups to respond 
Our control group took
an average
of minutes and seconds
to decide on their punishments 
but our experimental group
took an average
of minutes seconds 
In a sense 
that really is the prediction 
The right thing
by their own worldview 
but by the same token 
when we think about death 
we want to do what s right 
And if we re acting
like jurors 
we want to make
the right decisions 
As we very much learned today 
the goal isn t to prove
one thing one way or the other 
It s just to reduce
uncertainty 
 That s correct 
 in the most careful way 
Absolutely To know a little bit
more today than yesterday 
Our pilot test shows
that there s still a lot
to discover
about terror management
and many promising ways
to do it 
I m particularly intrigued
by our observation
that for all
the closed mindedness
mortality salience
appears to cause 
it also lead
to what looked like
increased consideration
and thought 
I d love to see more research
on that idea 
But the point is this 
if death s effects
aren t all entirely bad 
what if instead of 
or at least at the same time
that we hope for the abolition
of natural death 
we also find a way
to accept it 
Now obviously I don t
want to die at least not soon 
But accepting the inevitability
of my own death
and being less afraid of it
feels powerful and honest 
I d like to learn
what that looks like 
And I have a friend
who can help 
I m paying a visit
to Caitlin Doughty 
a mortician author 
and death positivity activist 
who has made an entire career
out of discussing
the aspects of death that
most of us prefer to ignore 
What do you say to someone
who comes to you and says 
I think death is terrifying 
It s 
so scary and sad
that I m just here now 
Is this person dying 
or is this person 
This person is me
in front of you right now 
This person is you 
Okay so 
I would tell you
a couple things 
First you re dealing with
the primal existential quandary
of human existence 
 And you are one of you know 
the many billions of people
who have felt this 
So you re not alone
in feeling this way 
So we go through life 
We reach a certain age 
and we begin to understand
that someday ourselves
and everyone we love will die 
And that s powerful 
painful knowledge 
And I think from that moment 
We have to start developing
defense mechanisms
to handle that and to integrate
that into our lives 
So what are those defense
mechanisms 
I think that the more obvious
ones would be having a child 
writing a book 
making a TV show 
creating a legacy
of some kind 
But there s also a more
insidious version 
which is war 
Taking other countries 
Being rich and being okay with
other people being poor 
I think those are all signs
of death denial 
They re all saying 
But I m okay 
because I have this money 
or I have this power or I have
these kind of dark impulses
that allow me to say at least
I can outrun death in that way 
And of course 
that s not true 
No one can outrun death 
But you can trick yourself
into believing that 
So how would you
characterize
the Western relationship
to death 
Take America years ago 
If you were my husband
and you died 
I would be entirely
in charge of you 
I would wash your body 
I would get the neighbor
to make a wooden coffin for you 
We would put you in the coffin
and carry you on our shoulders 
to the grave which someone
had dug themselves 
 It would have been
an entirely self sufficient
process 
But what happened around
the turn of the th century
is really three big things
One you had the rise
of hospitals 
So people were no longer
dying at home 
You had the rise
of funeral homes 
which means that we are now
outsourcing our death 
The third one
is slaughterhouses 
So all of a sudden 
all food production
and the killing of animals
is also hidden as well 
And we live in
our suburban houses 
where all those things
are outsourced 
And it s just these layers and
layers of denial around death 
But what does it mean
to accept death 
I don t think that you ever
truly accept death 
But I believe that the movement
toward accepting death
involves really true
self awareness
about where you re hiding
your fears of death 
That s where real awareness
and acceptance can come from 
For me the thing that s just
such a bummer about death
is that I just am done 
I don t get to continue
learning things
and seeing what happens 
And I m just not part
of Earth anymore 
Isn t death kind of what gives
you that passion 
when you think about it 
Like I love learning 
I love ideas 
If you didn t have an end point 
are you going to come in here
with all these cameras and do
the huge amount of legwork
 that creating a show requires 
No Right Because you re like 
I don t know maybe I ll do it
 years from now 
Whereas right now you re taking
in information left and right 
because you want
to produce content 
You want to produce
exciting things
and share with other people 
 Because this is my one chance 
 This is your one chance 
The passion and the realness
to life comes from an ending 
That s the great gift
that death gives us 
What s an unhealthy relationship
to have to your own mortality 
The pursuit of immortality 
and the pursuit of 
I will stay alive
until I can upload my brain
into the cloud 
That worries me 
The idea that everyone
is just allowed
to live forever
from here on out
is not environmentally sensible 
It s not You know it s just
not a sensible position to take 
 narrator 
We are seeing the dawn
of a new era
of possibilities unfold
on planet Earth 
What will our amazing world
be like in say 
 or even years
from now 
Wouldn t you like
the possibility
of finding out 
To understand why some people
feel like death shouldn t
be inevitable 
I ve come to Alcor 
one of the world s leading
life extension facilities 
 Linda Hi I m Michael 
 Hi how are you 
 Great to meet you 
 Nice to meet you too 
 Welcome to Alcor 
 Thank you for having me here 
I m meeting Linda Chamberlin 
who co founded Alcor
nearly years ago 
So this facility that we are in
right now
is where you both cryo preserve
people and store them 
 Linda 
Yes We have patients 
 And we have
eleven hundred
and ninety something members 
 It changes 
 And a member is someone
 who is alive today but has 
 Alive today 
They ve made the arrangements
for this 
Once they are cryo preserved 
they become patients 
You re using
the word patient 
Tell me about why you use
that word 
For us death is not something
which is like an on off switch 
One second you re alive 
the next second you re dead 
 What we are trying to do
is to slow down and stop
the dying process 
To become a patient at Alcor 
first you have to pay
between and 
Then you have to die 
or more specifically 
be pronounced clinically dead 
This generally means
that your heart and lungs
have stopped functioning 
At that point 
Alcor can begin their work 
Now there are two ways
that a person could sign up
for this procedure 
There s a whole body patient 
or as a neuro 
Oh and does neuro 
just mean head 
It means yes 
the cephalon actually 
which is all of the structures
down to about the clavicle 
 I m a neuro 
Everybody in my family 
who s now in stasis is a neuro 
 Most of the people
who really understand
the technology are neuros 
The primary reason that people
choose whole body is emotional 
 Of course 
 And they re not comfortable
with the idea of their body
being removed and discarded 
So let s say that our patient
is whole body 
The moment the patient
is pronounced 
they go into an ice bath 
And this is just crushed ice 
And it s water
in there as well 
Their heart has started again
with a mechanical thumper 
They re intubated and their
lungs are functioning again 
Being ventilated 
Circulating the cooler
temperatures 
Yeah yeah yeah 
So you need the veins 
the arteries 
the vasculature the heart 
You need all of those continuing
to pump and circulate 
This is our operating room 
So basically 
when the patient comes in
through the door there 
they ll go into this specially
developed operating table 
It is going to be circulating
nitrogen gas over them
to help cool them externally 
And if it s a whole body
patient 
then the surgeons
open the chest 
and then we begin circulating
the organ transplant solution 
Once in the operating room 
the patient s blood
is replaced
with cooled organ
transplant fluid
and circulated
through the vascular system
to rapidly cool down
the internal
and external temperatures
of the body 
Just before the water
within the body tissue
reaches its freezing point 
cryo protective fluids
are introduced 
These act like antifreeze 
preventing the formation
of ice crystals
that could damage
soft tissue 
This is called
the vitrification process 
Now say that it is
a neuro patient 
 So they come in first here 
 Yup their whole body 
Right The surgeons will do
the neuro separation first 
 Okay yeah that makes sense 
 Separate the cephalon 
Bring it over here
to this operating field 
We ll wash the blood out 
And we introduce the organ
transplant solution 
I m imagining
a person s cephalon 
essentially their head 
in here 
I can see how it s going
to get clamped in 
That looks like I m sure 
a crazy sci fi movie 
 But it really happens 
 It really happens 
After the vitrification process
is complete 
the patients are placed
inside bags
that are attached
to open metal cases 
which are then placed inside
cylindrical tanks
filled with liquid nitrogen 
called dewars 
So this is our
patient care bay 
We have patients 
 In these tanks right here 
 In these tanks 
There are approximately
nine patients
in each one of these 
Four whole bodies
and five neuros 
This one right here
is where my husband
is currently housed 
 This one right here 
This is where Fred is
at the moment 
My mother and my father in law
are 
in this one 
Wow it s so weird 
because I am right now
not in a graveyard 
No Alcor is very much
like an ambulance
taking their loved ones
to a hospital
not down the street 
 but a hospital in the future 
When technology
can help them 
They re not being transported
through space 
 but through time 
 Time 
 Michael To see what drives
this time traveling ambulance 
I m going to sit down
with Max More 
Alcor s CEO 
and a future neuro patient 
So Max what s the status
of the technology needed
to revive cryo preserved
specimens 
 Are we getting closer 
 We are getting closer 
It s going to be decades 
at least 
before we can bring back
whole human beings 
But we already cryo preserve
eggs sperm 
microbes of skin corneas 
heart valves 
all kinds of things 
So those are single tissues 
And we can reverse that process 
 You move from that to an organ 
things get more difficult 
But we actually did an
experiment a few years ago 
We took this little tiny worm 
We used a certain chemical
so we d learn that 
oh my food s over here
and not over here 
And we cryo preserved them 
And then we just waited 
brought them back 
and then we tested them 
We were able to demonstrate
with the memory test
that the ones that have received
the training
retained that memory 
So it was the first time
any organism
we ve proven to survive
with memory 
So now we re asking okay 
what s the next step 
Because whole organisms are
difficult to reverse right now 
But step by step 
the more progress we can make 
 the more convincing this is 
When it comes
to extending life 
some questions come up like 
should people die 
I know we don t like
the idea of death 
 I know what you re getting at 
 But you lose something
by getting rid of death 
Yeah we ll lose something
like we lost something
when we got rid of slavery
or smallpox 
So I think people 
people are tying themselves
in knots to rationalize death 
I believe that 
right now 
we re kind of in
this tragic situation where 
over time hopefully
you kind of learn 
Your wisdom grows over time 
At the same time 
your cognitive and physical
health is declining 
That really sucks 
That s a bad situation 
What if they both could keep
going up indefinitely 
So you could live for hundreds
of years or longer 
and get smarter and more
knowledgeable and wiser 
Hopefully more mature 
and have more foresight
because you got a much longer
planning horizon 
What we ll have is a world
of I call ultra mature people 
which I think will actually
be a better world
than the one
we have today 
And if they say well 
And this comes up all the time 
They say Well death is what
gives life meaning 
Bullshit okay 
If that was true 
then would they also advocate
people who live to 
should be killed off at 
Will that double the meaning
in their life 
In fact I think life gets more
meaning the longer you live 
because you can build
on what you ve done before 
So if anything it increases
the meaningfulness of life 
in my view 
You re making me realize
that in many ways 
I am rationalizing death 
I m looking for ways
to excuse it and accept it 
I don t think it s unhealthy
to accept that you are mortal 
Well I have to accept it 
because I could get killed
at any time 
One thing I have to stress 
because every
article written 
they always have to use
the word forever 
or immortality 
And that s not
on the table here 
We re just offering a chance
for people to be revived
when we ve beaten aging 
And eventually something s
going to get you 
So we re not offering
immortality 
Do I think that someday we will
be able to cryonically freeze
an entire person
and then revive them 
Yes I do 
I believe that
cryopreservation
will change the meaning
of death 
and lead to breakthroughs
in medical technology
that will improve
all of our lives 
But do I want to extend my life
indefinitely 
Well on the one hand 
obviously death
is a bummer 
But on the other 
the universe managed fine
without me
for billions of years 
Am I really so important
that it should never
not have me again 
Should I be around
as long as possible 
Or do those who will come later
deserve their own world 
Should I try
to extend my life 
Or should I decide to die
when my time comes
and return all this matter
I m borrowing back to the world 
Well I don t think
there s a right answer 
It s a personal choice
we each get to make 
and should be able to make 
And I ve been thinking
about it a lot 
So I m going to speak again
with my friend Caitlin 
the mortician 
to confront my own mortality 
Well Caitlin thanks for
meeting with me again 
I ve been surrounded
by death lately 
Spoke to you 
I visited Alcor 
And you know 
if we never invented technology
to bring people back 
then the Alcor patients
are dead 
But they have that hope 
I worked on
And I even had a loved one
pass away just two weeks ago 
 My grandmother 
 Oh I m sorry to hear that 
She was cremated 
as was my father 
And I realized you know 
I ve never made a clear decision
about what should happen to me 
Because I just figured
I ll figure that out
when I m older 
 But I could die at any time 
 You sure could 
So I want to be prepared 
And I want my wishes
to be known 
 So I have decided
when that moment comes 
I want it to be my final moment
of existence 
I want to give all my atoms and
molecules back to the universe 
And I ve decided that
I want to die 
Oh I m so glad
you ve made that decision 
And you ve come
to the right place 
I want to be naturally buried 
I want to have a green burial 
You know become worm food
and plant food 
I want it all
to go back to earth 
But I kind of want a place
where people can come
to be like 
that s where he was buried 
So there s everything from
just little discs in the ground
where you are 
to GPS that locates you 
to natural cemeteries
that are trying to reintroduce
native plants 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 So you know 
you can have your own
Joshua tree 
So the first thing I m going
to give you to give a look over
is what s called
an advanced directive 
 And everybody needs
to have one of these 
And why it s so important
is that it s you
not only designating someone
to be in charge of your body
as you re dying 
right after you die 
and then with however you decide
to dispose of it 
But also who that person is 
So this isn t just about burial 
This is dying 
It s about death dying 
death and after death 
 Interesting 
A choice like this
is extremely new to humans 
It used to be your only options
upon death
were cremation embalming 
or rotting away 
But today you can chose to
pause yourself at death s door
until the door has been moved
somewhere else 
But I ve decided
not to do that 
So I m ready to make this
official 
 Fire in the hole 
 Whoo All right 
 How do you feel 
Weirdly I feel
very relaxed and good 
It was kind of life changing 
but what it really was
was death changing 
Ha well thank you and
I m glad you ve decided to die 
thank you for showing me
the power of death s influence 
Caitlin thank you
for helping me accept it 
Max thank you for the work
you are doing
and the opportunities
you are offering humanity 
And all you out there 
as always thanks for watching 
﻿ dramatic music playing 
This is McGill University
in Montreal Canada 
It boasts an enrollment of more
than students
from countries 
The campus employs
 professors
teaching programs
of study 
and it s proud to be home
to Nobel Prize winners 
It is considered
one of the finest
research universities
in the world 
Recently researchers at McGill
have embarked on a study
that uses a brain scanning
device to read people s minds
and implant thoughts
into their heads 
Or so their subjects think 
Now the same device may be able
to help kids with ADHD 
anxiety 
obsessive compulsive disorder 
migraines 
Tourette s and more 
This study is not
about technology 
The MRI machine behind me
may look impressive 
but it s a sham 
It s deactivated 
nonfunctioning 
What this study
is really about
is faith in science 
It s about the power
of thoughts to heal 
All you need is the power
of suggestion 
A placebo is something
that shouldn t work 
but due to the power
of suggestion
and because of the strength
of our belief does 
But we don t fully understand
yet how they work 
There could be
an evolutionary explanation 
For example if a small child
hurts themselves 
negative symptoms like pain
and crying can be good 
They keep the child safe
and still
while signaling adults
to come help 
When help arrives 
even if it
has no active effect 
the child s brain may feel
it has permission to redirect
resources away
from seeking help
and onto actually healing 
Modern medicine has found
a way to harness this power
by prescribing placebos 
But not all placebos work
the same 
For example a sugar pill
will help your headache more
if given to you by a doctor
than by a poker buddy 
And the color
of the placebo matters too 
A blue pill will work
to make you feel calm
better than a white pill
because blue
is a more calming color 
And a red pill
will keep you awake
and give you more energy
than a blue pill will 
A capsule will work
better than a pill
because it looks
more important 
Also an injection will work
better than a capsule
because it seems
more serious
and potent 
There s even evidence
that fake or sham surgeries
have positive effects 
It may be fake medicine 
but the effects can be real 
And not just because the patient
feels better psychologically 
We re talking
real physical healing 
thanks to the power
of the brain 
I traveled to Montreal
to meet local children
struggling
with debilitating behavioral
and neurological conditions
who would soon find out
whether their afflictions
could be cured
by the power of suggestion 
 This is Malaya 
Malaya I m Michael 
Nice to meet you 
Twelve year old Malaya
suffers from a common
skin ailment eczema 
But she has also developed
a skin picking disorder 
dermatillomania 
You re starting high school
what like this year 
Early September 
Wow that s a big step 
So what kind of things 
like worry you 
uh given the symptoms
that you have 
Probably the picking 
 Of your skin 
 Malaya Yeah 
I don t know I find
it satisfying to pick 
It s kind of gross 
you can t stop 
I m not sure 
Have you tried
different things
that ll help you stop 
Yeah Like in my mind 
I m just like 
Today you won t pick 
You are gonna get rid
of this eczema 
And then after 
Oh wait My face is 
like bleeding 
 Yeah Is it embarrassing 
I like to wear long sleeves
because my arms are like 
if they re really bad 
I m gonna try to wear
long sleeves 
How are your arms now 
It s like really bad 
So as you can see 
And it s all just
from scratching and picking 
Twelve year old Nicholas
was troubled
by debilitating
migraine headaches 
So what do you wanna
be when you grow up 
Like I really 
really wanna be 
uh probably like an NHL
or an MLB player 
one of those two 
Nicholas s love of sports
is unfortunately also
the original source
of his suffering 
My first head injury 
which was concussion 
I hit my head
on a soccer post 
And then I hit my head
in a game of uh hockey 
Uh after that I had headaches
every single day 
I was throwing up 
having auras 
they re like uh colors
that you see before
you have a headache 
I wasn t able to go
to school 
and then we went
to the hospital
and into their
concussion program 
Can I see
his migraine chart 
Oh sure Yeah We have
almost two years worth 
Severe headaches here 
severe migraines 
 Michael Every day 
 Danielle Every single day 
This has turned
his world upside down 
Nathan was diagnosed with ADHD
and impulse control disorder 
I d love to hear especially
about you Nathan 
how old are you 
 Nine 
 Michael Nine 
 How old you are 
 Michael How old
do you think I am 
 Thirty 
 That s a very good guess 
 I m 
 Ooh 
So tell me about like 
before Nathan s diagnosis 
What were kind of the symptoms
you were seeing 
Tantrums all the time um 
just an inability
to reach him 
to communicate to him 
to connect to him 
that was the main symptom 
And what did you
think of this Nathan 
Were you like Why are
my parents not happy 
 Why weren t you 
 Nathan I don t know 
Maybe because I have problems 
And as far as 
like behavior 
Impulsivity 
hyperactivity 
and you re always 
always on the edge 
always stressed 
what is he gonna touch 
where is he gonna go 
what is he gonna do 
These families had tried
conventional methods
to treat their children
with little success 
But they were about
to find out
whether their symptoms
could be alleviated
using an accessory assisted
placebo 
a fake non functioning
MRI machine 
This groundbreaking study
of the power of suggestion
and action is the brainchild
of pioneering researchers
at McGill University s
esteemed Raz Lab 
We study a whole bunch
of different mind body
interaction topics 
suggestion 
hypnosis placebo effects 
Anytime the mind is regulating
the body or vice versa 
that s a topic
that we study 
Now you said
the word placebo 
And the device
that we are using
is a sham scanner 
the scanner 
 Jay What we do
with the MRI scanners is
we stack so many different
layers of deception 
In their head this is
a proper neuroscience study
done at the neurological
institute 
And that s why we wear
lab coats 
That s why we have
all of this
scientific looking
By the time they ve actually
started the study 
they ve already in their mind
built up all these different
layers of credibility 
They really believe that
what we re doing is real 
 Dr Veissiere What s
interesting is that children 
they re not immune to the power
of neuroenchantment 
 Neuroenchantment 
 Neuroenchantment 
 So it s this idea
that there is some kind
of medical magic 
There is immense power
that is attached
to the culture
of neuroscience
whereby neuroscientific props
and accessories
have more healing power 
more physiological effects 
because culturally
people believe that they do 
I mean the same kind
of cultural cognitive mechanisms
are at play
in religious systems 
So here we are praying
to the gods of neuroscience
and biomedicine 
Talk to me about
the ethics of lying 
The work we do
with children
actually does not
involve lying 
We tell them at first
that everything that they see
and everything that we do
in the lab is a suggestion 
We explain to them
that suggestion is a way to tap
into the power
of their mind 
We keep emphasizing even
as they go in the scanner
that it is their mind
and their brain
that is doing the healing 
that they re basically
reprogramming their own brain 
The parents knew
that the scanner was a placebo 
But for the study to work 
the children
had to believe
in the procedure 
So before they visited
the lab 
I enlisted
a few YouTuber friends
to help raise
their expectations 
 Veronica Hey guys 
Today we have
a huge surprise for you
about something
brand new in science
that could affect you 
Oh I know them 
we learned about
this amazing new machie
that teaches kids brais
how to heal super fas 
We really hope that you get
the chance in person
to see how
this machine works 
With a little help
from the machine 
you can focus better 
be more confident 
 And it can even take away
some headaches 
 Vanessa Not too many
people get the chance
to have this
awesome experience 
but we hear
the scientists in Canada 
 I m going to have it 
And it s very cool 
So what do you hope
the machine
allows you to do
that makes you better at 
Better at concentrating 
better at focusing 
I wanna heal faster 
and this will probably
be a good idea 
I hope it heals me up
with my concussions
and then I hope
my headaches go away 
I was about to take part
in something remarkable 
the very first use of
accessory assisted suggestion
on children with these kinds of
symptoms 
Mind Field would play
an integral role in the study 
And the results could be
new and significant for science
On the day
of the first session 
several measures
were put in place
to heighten the children s
neuroenchantment 
 Nathan 
 Nathan Nathan 
A friendly fake nurse 
a walk down a long 
impressive hallway 
 and a ten minute
anticipation
building wait
outside the lab 
Then it was time
for their first scan 
Shall we 
While the hypothesis
of this study
was grounded in science 
this was Dr Veissiere
and Jay Olson s first time
testing their theory
on real children
with real disorders 
and they didn t know
if it would work 
You may lie down
if you d like 
One of my roles was
to help build up
the children s belief
that it would work 
As you go into the machine 
you ll relax more and more 
Would you like to relax
slowly or quickly today 
 Uh I can go in quickly 
 Oh wow nice 
Very good 
Although the MRI scanner
was completely deactivated 
we needed the kids to believe
 it was fully functional 
 machine beeps 
So Jay played a series
of realistic sound effects
to signify that
the machine was working 
while Dr Veissiere
planted the suggestion
that it would help
the patient heal 
You might notice
some unusual feelings 
perhaps a tingling 
is continuing to learn 
and to heal 
and to help you find
this constant feeling
of confidence 
If all went well 
the placebo effect
of the sham brain scanner
would convince
the children s conscious minds
that real neuroscience
was at work 
Take a deep deep breath 
This would allow
their subconscious minds
to harness the power
of their brains
to heal themselves 
For people with migraines 
it s often in the front
or the back part of the head 
but it could also
be like a feeling
like outside the head 
So I m not sure what it s
gonna be like for you 
We ll find out afterwards 
So we ll now slide you in 
Cool it s like
a roller coaster 
I love roller coasters 
The deeper you go in 
the more you ll relax 
Okay I wanna go
all the way deep 
 machine beeps 
I know This is because you re
already at level three 
that deeper feeling
of relaxation 
The scientists at McGill
believe that children s brains
have always had the ability
to control their symptoms 
The children just needed
to believe it themselves 
 sneezes 
Yeah So the beeps can
sometimes make people sneeze
as a sign of their relaxing
just very deeply 
Right Very well 
You did very 
very well Nathan 
The children all appeared
to enjoy the procedure 
and the researchers and I
did our best
to reinforce
their neuroenchantment 
So when you heard
the first set of beeps
and the second set of beeps 
did you notice feeling
them in different parts
of your body 
Well the first time
I went in the machine 
I kind of felt it here 
 Okay Good 
 What level was
she taken to today 
Level two 
 Level two 
 Yeah Level two is great 
When I was in the machine 
I felt like I was going 
like backwards
and forwards 
Okay That s very good 
That s a very good sign 
You might have noticed
how you were yawning 
That s great 
For a kid
with hyperactivity 
Nathan was already
appearing calmer 
But before our young subjects
left the lab 
Dr Veissiere
bolstered the suggestion
that today s session
would help them
continue
their healing process 
 Dr Veissiere 
So I know for sure
that you re gonna
be more relaxed 
much much less anxious 
I would not
be surprised at all
if the scratching
really diminished
to no scratching at all 
The amazing thing
about the brain
is that it has
this fantastic power
to heal itself 
But now what we ve
been able to do here
with the power
is to get your brain
to work faster
and better
all the time 
So how do you feel 
 Amazing 
Mind Field
provided the Raz Lab
with Octopus
by JOY smart watches 
 Nathan Leftie rules 
They were specially programmed
to remind the children
in between visits
that their brain
was healing itself 
 Dr Veissiere Just having
the watch with you
will make you feel better 
But it s not the watch
or it s not the machine
that s making you feel good 
it s your own brain 
In six weeks 
we would return to the lab
to check in on their progress 
 dramatic music playing 
This high tech contraption
is pretty much
what McGill University s first
sham brain scanner looked like 
It was an old discarded
hair dryer 
But the patients
didn t know that 
In the original study 
 undergraduate students
were told that it was able
to reduce pain 
cause amnesia 
influence sexual attraction 
and produce various
other impressive effects 
The lab s new more modern
sham brain scanner
shows even more promise 
And I was invited
to participate in its test
on a whole new group
of adult subjects 
Okay so you can come in here
and just grab a seat 
These college students are fully
aware
of what s possible today with
neuroscience 
Could even they be
neuroenchanted enough
to believe in the impossible 
that an MRI scanner could read
their thoughts 
Now we re looking
at cutting edge
 psychological research 
Yes It s part of the neural
activation mapping project 
We re gonna be putting
you in an MRI 
So uh it s a modified one 
it s called the CTMSF MRI 
 So Combined Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation
Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging 
which is a big word just
meaning it can both read
 and influence thoughts 
 All right Okay 
So you ll be choosing
a number from to 
 Jay And then
from looking at your 
uh neural activation
patterns 
Dr Veissiere here
will try to infer
 which number you re thinking 
 Hmm interesting 
 Okay great 
Most adults know
the basics about MRIs 
so we made sure to cover
every detail 
In the scanner 
the magnetism is a lot less 
That s good
for documentary team 
they can bring a camera 
So that said 
we do have to remove
the metal glasses 
 Got it All this 
 After this realistic 
but completely
unnecessary step 
it was time to begin our fake
mind reading experiment 
So we re gonna start
the calibration 
So try to stay
very still 
Of course there was actually
nothing to calibrate 
but we were conditioning
with the expected
procedures sights 
and sounds
of a real MRI study 
 machine sounds 
Okay Think
of the number one 
The subjects
were asked to concentrate
on the numbers zero to nine 
while the machine supposedly
mapped parts of their brains 
Think of the number nine 
and I remained in character
at all times 
pretending to analyze
the subject s brain activity 
But the images on our screens
were actually old MRI scans
from former patients 
 Is the calibration good 
 Looks pretty good to me 
With our subject now primed 
to convince her
that the scanner
could identify a number
she was thinking of
by reading her mind 
 Jay You re gonna choose
 You re gonna hear a beep 
Then you ll hear
a second beep 
So you re always
making your decision
 between the two beeps 
 Okay 
 Got it 
 So I ll slide you in 
So hold on to that number
for just a second 
 Um uh they re gonna print
 it out and then we ll see 
It was pretty clear 
We pretended to give Jay
the results
of the MRI s analysis 
but actually Jay was about
to add the subject s number
to the document
with a little sleight of hand 
Okay So you can stay lying
down just for a second 
 What was the number 
 Thirty one 
Thirty one Uh okay cool 
So if you can sit up here 
 Jay But it s pretty close 
but it swapped huh 
Yeah Okay 
That miss
was actually intentional
so that the results
didn t appear to be perfect 
adding to the realism 
So um are you
doing well 
We ll do we ll do
another trial with this 
The same thing okay 
Slide you in 
Michelle thought
of a new number 
Would the scanner
get it right this time 
 Super clear 
 It s clear 
Really good this time 
 Jay All right 
They think the signal is clear 
 What was your number 
 Twenty seven 
Uh did you say 
 Oh okay great Yeah 
So uh 
if you can sit up here 
Yes Oh wow What 
Crazy 
 So you chose 
And the technician
thought as well 
 Michelle All right 
Um I didn t expect it
to be so specific 
 Um a lot of different areas
could be lighting up
just to think of
the concept of a number 
What do you know it worked 
Thanks to the wonders
or rather the skills of Jay 
who in addition to being
a neuroscientist
happens to be a professional
magician on the side 
While Jay won t reveal
the secret of the trick 
the mind reading illusion
is very similar
to the mentalist s tricks
that have entertained audiences
for over a century 
The only difference
is that when audiences
see the stunt performed
in a magic setting 
they think it s a great trick 
not real science 
 The machine had 
 laughs That s cool 
However in the impressive
scientific setting
of the Raz Lab 
these subjects thought
our magic trick
was real science 
 Jay Right here 
that the real science
 they were experiencing 
 It s pretty cool 
 was the power of suggestion 
A dose of neuroenchantment this
powerful
can make for a formidable
and effective placebo 
I wanna talk about
the physical sensation 
 What was your experience 
It felt like a headache
was coming on 
It sort of felt
like uh like 
 tingling through my head 
 Up where 
Uh just through this area 
like this whole area
felt more like full 
I felt like 
uh sort of uh 
a pressure or something
like that 
It was uh 
a strange feeling 
 Like back here a little bit 
 In the back 
Yeah a little bit
Somewhere in the back
of the head Interesting 
I wanna hear
what it felt like
to have your mind read 
That was very strange 
I think I was
probably skeptical 
like going into it 
and then I couldn t
figure out as I
was thinking like why 
how that would
happen otherwise 
and so I m just 
I think in a baffled state 
It was time to clear up
this baffling mystery 
So some deception
has been going on today 
Dr Olsen is uh 
not reading your mind 
Neither is this machine 
 This machine is deactivated 
 How Okay 
All the noises
were coming from a speaker 
It was an illusion 
That s pretty cool 
 The sounds you re hearing
are not magnets 
it s just from a speaker 
The machine in there
is actually deactivated 
 it s not working 
 Wow it s like placebo 
 Dr Veissiere Yeah yeah 
That s exactly what it is 
Now imagine tapping
into this power
for other effects
 like healing for example 
I definitely believe
is alive and well 
There s evidence
that the power of suggestion
even works on animals 
A study at North Carolina
found that of dogs
receiving real seizure
medication
had a reduction in seizures 
But almost as many 
a full 
experience the same effect
from just a placebo pill 
And we don t know how a placebo
affects a dog s brain 
but it could be that dogs
have learned to associate
vet visits
and medicine from humans
with feeling better 
So giving them a placebo
could help a dog s brain
heal itself 
 Dr Veissiere So first
I ll ask you to lie down again 
And of course 
you re total pro at this 
For several weeks 
had undergone sessions
in the sham scanner
at McGill University 
The body continues to relax
as we keep unleashing
this healing energy 
Each time
they were reminded
that through concentration
and relaxation 
they were helping heal
their own brains 
Finally after six weeks
of receiving
the placebo sessions 
it was time to get a report
on the results 
Malaya suffered from anxiety
and a compulsive
skin picking disorder 
Had she experienced
any level of success 
 It s good to see you 
and take a seat 
You re wearing 
like not even 
I thought maybe you d
have short sleeves on 
You ve just got
a tank top on 
Your arms look fantastic 
They ve really gotten better 
And your face 
I mean all of it 
you re better 
 I m guessing it s the machine 
 Yeah what about it 
Uh I m not really sure
how it works 
but I m picking
a lot less 
Sometimes if I see 
like a tiny flake 
I ll just leave it there 
That s a pretty
short amount of time
for such a big change
in the way you think
and behave 
That s awesome 
I don t really feel
the urge to do it
as much as I did before 
So it s a big improvement 
Yeah that definitely feels
like and sounds like
your brain
being powerful 
 Malaya It s obviously
doing something
because my arms are better 
Well you seem
a lot more confident 
Holding your head up higher 
Would you agree 
Anne Marie 
She seems
less anxious 
She s more
positive overall 
 I was hoping for this 
 It s wonderful to see 
 more than this
to see her going 
Well good work 
And as for Nicholas
and his migraine headaches 
It s good to see
you again Nicholas 
Tell me about the procedure
and how you felt afterwards 
It accomplished all the things
that I wanted it to 
and I haven t had
a migraine at all 
And concentration is
a big thing that helped 
Wow And can I see
the symptom charts 
 So these go back to February 
Yeah well 
they re really telling 
And you can see not good 
lots going on 
But then recently 
no migraines at all 
So now you said you went
to the neurologist 
They thought
it was quite remarkable 
He hasn t needed any 
uh rescue medication 
he hasn t need the preventer 
um and he s not
having migraines 
I m actually really
excited for high school 
Both Malaya
and Nicholas attribute
their improvements
to the sham scanner 
They believed
it was working for them 
and indeed it did 
So how did Nathan 
who suffered from ADHD
and impulse control disorder 
fare over the last six weeks 
Well I received a home video
from Nathan s mother
with an update on his progres 
So um the best part about
going through the treatment
was um just what
it did to our son 
We noticed a difference
in Nathan
immediately
after the first session 
And do you remember
 I slept 
 Yeah He slept 
Something he doesn t do
very often during the day 
He slept for two hours 
Um he was refreshed 
It was just incredible to see 
And then what happened
was the entire summer
we had him off the medicine 
and he did great 
He thought about stuff
before he did it 
we were able
to talk things out 
and uh it s been fun 
So overall we re
very pleased and you know 
we just we had such
a great experience 
so thank you very much 
The children s results
are encouraging 
and a powerful sign of how
effective suggestions 
and our willingness to believe
them can be 
In time the kids will
understand how all of the power
was within them and not in the
scanner 
This work is
truly cutting edge 
This hasn t
We also think of this
as a great new way
to do science
and to collaborate 
So much more of the public
will see what s being done 
Yes Science isn t just
about publishing a paper
that nobody reads 
It s about spreading
the ideas that you find 
 Hundred percent 
 As far as I m concerned 
you re already
a co author
in our scientific
experimental paper 
Wow very cool 
The children s improvements
were caused
by the placebo effect 
and no deception
was used to mask that 
the machine was deactivated 
and the children
were only told
that it had the power
to put a suggestion
in their brain a suggestion
that ultimately came
from themselves 
But surely the more people
learn about placebos
and their lack
of intrinsic power 
the less effective
they ll be right 
Studies show
that even when subjects
learn that their treatment
was a placebo 
the positive results
do not go away 
What the subjects have learned
about how to heal themselves
remains with them 
It was an honor to have been
a part of this study 
I think this is Mind Field
at its best 
using our resources
to help researchers
with their work
and helping the public
see how the brain is studied 
Placebos can t fix everything 
but these kids
always had the power
to start healing 
All they needed
was the power of suggestion 
﻿ If I asked you to show me
a picture of your mother 
you wouldn t show me a uh 
closeup shot of her elbow 
But you could 
and you d be right 
That would be a photo of her 
but it wouldn t feel right
because it s not her face 
That s how important faces are
to us 
We re going to see if forcing
a facial expression
can change the way we feel 
 Are you comfortable
handling dog feces 
 And if you remove the ability
to make facial expressions 
will it affect how you
perceive emotions in others 
 How could that that no 
 I don t think so 
 And what are we saying
by raising an eyebrow 
Do you know 
Why does doing this
make me look angry 
And why does doing this
make me look so happy 
Where does all this stuff
come from 
to interpersonal communication 
it s easy to think
that speech dominates 
but yet 
we have hairless faces 
That s very unique
among mammals
that are easy
to see expressions on 
Facial expressions are
shared across humanity 
A smile is a smile
in any language 
Our faces seem uniquely adapted
for communication 
Before we developed language 
facial expressions
may have been just as vital
as shouts and grunts 
And we of course 
still use them today 
But when it comes
to facial expressions 
it s not just about seeing
other people s expressions
and having them see yours 
It s also about seeing your own 
And the fact that our eyes
are deep set
allows us to see our own
as we re making them 
If you smile 
you can see
your own cheeks rise slightly 
And if you furrow your brow 
it encroaches on the top
of your vision 
These things give you
instant feedback
on the degree to which you are
altering your face
and tell you instantly
what sort of expression
you are putting out
into the world 
No mirror required 
Some of the most interesting
on facial expressions
have asked What comes first 
The emotion
or the facial expression 
Studies have found
that if you hold a pencil
between your teeth all day 
you will have a better day 
Well because holding a pencil
between your teeth
without your lips touching
is like smiling 
It uses pretty much
the same muscles 
Watch 
 muffled I don t know 
I don t know I m smiling 
but I am 
Conversely pursing your lips
around the pencil
is like frowning 
And studies have found
that if someone does that 
they will actually report having
a less good day 
Well we re gonna put that
to the test
and find out if
the facial contortions you make
can subconsciously affect
how you feel 
Studies on how
physiology affects mood
go as far back as the s 
with early research carried out
by Charles Darwin
and French neurologist
Duchenne de Boulogne 
This work has continued
into present day
using various techniques
to create smiles and frowns 
But studies
have been inconsistent
as to whether
can influence emotions 
so we wanted to see
if we could demonstrate
a correlation between the two 
 Come on in guys 
Chris my name is Michael 
My name is Michael 
We ve recruited volunteers
who think they re taking part
in an allergy study 
Today we are testing
a new kind of dog food 
and it actually seems to help
dogs produce fewer allergens 
so people who are allergic
to dogs
might be more comfortable
around them 
And we re going to be using
these allergen sticks 
Now the purpose of this stick
is to collect saliva
to check the way
your body reacts
to possible allergens
in the air 
Put it between your teeth
like that okay 
 Half of our participants
will be unknowingly forced
into a smile 
Yeah very simple 
 The other half
will unwittingly be forced
to use their frown muscles 
My teeth are together 
and then hmm 
Got it 
both Mm hmm 
 We re gonna give the frowners
and the smilers
the same two tasks 
Go ahead 
and I ll see you guys soon 
Will the people who were forced
to frown
rank each task lower
than those made to smile 
 Come on in 
 To test their levels
of happiness 
our actor Trin 
gave our subjects a task
everybody loves 
puppy herding
with lots and lots of puppies 
First up are our smilers 
 They re all wearing
little tags 
 So your job is to line them up
in alphabetical order 
Once you got em all lined up 
I ll snap a photo of you 
 And you got three minutes
Starting now 
 Hello I know 
 Make sure they re
 They re naming the dogs 
 She s having fun 
 I just got the oh 
Don t go away 
 Swap those two 
 You got one minute left 
 This looks like fun 
but are they having
even more fun
because they re being forced
to smile 
 All right 
get ready for the photo 
 camera shutter clicks 
 Our smilers are laughing
and goofing around 
 Fantastic 
 Now let s see how
our frowners react
to this fun task 
 Three minutes 
 humming 
 He s running away from you 
 groans 
will frowning emphasize
the parts that aren t fun 
in your mind at least 
 dogs barking 
 Oh we lost F 
Got one little strangler
right over here 
 Ugh 
 If the frowners seem
a bit frustrated
herding puppies 
 mutters angrily 
 How will they like
their next task 
 If you would each grab
a pair of gloves 
Are you comfortable handling
dog feces 
And we re also going to be
looking at whether there are
any protein deposits
that have collected um 
in the fecal matter 
 She s like Are you serious 
 So go ahead and spread it out
on the table 
 stifled retching 
 Ooh 
Not happy 
 And what you re looking for
are small hard deposits 
 Not much indication
that there s a smile
trying to come through 
 exhales 
 Thank you that ll do it 
 Our frowners don t seem
to be enjoying this assignment 
Will the smilers have
a different reaction 
 Grab a pair of gloves 
It may be easier to kind of
smear it and spread it out 
 The hypothesis is 
that by smiling 
they ll focus more
on the funny aspects
of what they re about to do 
 laughs Yeah 
 There s disgust in his eyes
and his brow 
but his mouth can t help
but smile 
 Okay great guys 
Then when you re ready 
just follow me and we ll do
a debrief with Mr Stevens 
 Hey welcome back 
Now think about um 
organizing the puppies
and taking a photo of them 
 Mmm 
 And how you felt 
Tell me what you were thinking
and feeling while you were doing
that task 
 I mean the puppies
are extremely cute 
 Can I keep one 
Is it cool with you guys 
 The dogs actually cooperated
pretty well 
 Mm hmm 
 I was able
to put them in order 
 They re amazing 
 It wasn t stressful 
 So on a scale of to 
where is
you cannot tolerate it
and best day of your life 
how would you rank
the puppy photo task 
 I m gonna say like a 
 
 
 I m gonna go with an 
 A 
 That s an average
of 
from our small sample
of ten subjects
who were forced to smile
during the photo assignment 
Now let s see how the frowners
rated the same task 
How did you feel
while you were doing that 
 Um a little frustrated 
to be honest with you 
 cause they kept moving around 
 Well it was difficult
getting them to stay in place
and put them in order 
 How would you rank
the photo taking task 
 Mmm 
 About 
 A 
I love puppies 
 Still a 
 Yeah me too 
 I would go more
on the middle ground 
maybe like 
 Many of the frowners reported
feeling frustrated
with this experience 
tallying an average score
of 
more than a point lower
than the smilers 
Now let s talk about
the poop checking job 
 Very unpleasant 
 It was disgusting 
the poop checking task 
 it was a 
 A 
 It was for sure a 
 
 A 
 Is a zero possible 
 Our frowning subjects
averaged a low score of 
did our smiling group feel
any better about digging
through poo 
 It wasn t too uncomfortable 
 It was sort of unexpected but
it wasn t like it bothered me 
 I wasn t like disgusted
like Ew This is disgusting 
I just kind of held my breath 
 Many of our smilers reported
this unpleasant task
as being no big deal
or actually funny 
 I d say a 
because it wasn t 
neither here nor there for me 
 It was a 
 A high 
 I guess 
 A Okay 
 right in the middle 
 The average score
for the smiling group
was out of 
Smilers enjoyed
sifting through poop
an average of points more
than our frowners 
And have a great day 
 Have fun with your poop 
I will 
I always do 
Our test found that people
who made smile faces
enjoyed tasks more 
and those who frowned
enjoyed them less 
This facial feedback concept
is still being debated though 
And other studies
have recently failed
to reproduce these findings 
But it s a very healthy thing
that we don t just look
at one test and say 
Well that s it 
That must be the truth 
We re done 
In the words of Brian Nosek 
lead researcher
of the Reproducibility Project 
science isn t about truth
and falsity 
It s about reducing uncertainty 
Facial expressions
are so important
to human communication
that people develop ways
to read your face even if
they can t see it 
Tommy thanks for coming
to visit 
I love what you ve done
with the place 
 Hey thank you so much 
 What I would like
is facial expressions 
 All right sir 
 Cause Tommy 
you have been blind
since you were born 
 How did you learn
about facial expressions 
 Cause you make them 
You smile 
You I ve never seen you mad 
but I bet if you get mad 
 You I can tell 
 Yeah When I m laughing 
I smile right 
It just comes naturally 
 So that part s innate 
 That part is innate 
Absolutely it is no question 
But in order to imitate it 
that was the tricky part for me 
Right Cause sometimes
I d smile like too much 
You know like that 
Like I feel like
that s pushing it too hard 
That s not really natural 
But you know so it s probably
somewhere around here 
 So could you make
an angry face for me right now 
That s close 
but do you think
if you d seen an angry face
it would be easier to fake one 
 Yes I think so 
 Let me ask you this 
Can you tell what
facial expression I m making 
 Well when you re smiling 
I can hear it in your voice 
 Right It s very obvious 
 Cause when you smile 
your lips don t really touch
the right way so letters like M
and B and P for example 
you know they sound
just a little bit different 
So it sounds like you know more
about how a smile affects speech
than most sighted people would 
There s a lot of audible clues
that help me to get
the facial expression 
 Well Tommy 
thank you so much for coming in 
I love having guests
in my home 
 Thank you sir 
When we look
at other people s faces 
we often subconsciously imitate
their facial expressions 
It s called facial mirroring 
And it s a way for us
to let other people know
we understand them that we feel
the same things that they feel 
Facial mirroring begins
in infancy
and continuous throughout
our lives 
Studies have shown that if you
can t facially mirror 
if you can t express things
with your own face 
you actually have trouble
understanding
what other people s faces
are expressing 
So to try that out 
let s hinder some people s
facial muscles 
What s a good way to do that 
Well how about a dose
of botulinum toxin 
We have gathered a group
of volunteers
for a facial expression
recognition experiment 
Thank you all
for coming in today 
We re going to begin
with a test 
A test of your ability
to recognize
facial expressions 
Our participants will be shown
pictures of eyes
expressing either positive
or negative emotions 
Your task is to look
at each face and to decide
which of those four emotions
the face is expressing 
Makes sense 
Each photo is designed
to display
one standard emotion
that is known to elicit
an established consensus 
For example in this photo 
what emotion
would you identify 
If you said terrified 
you d be in the majority 
Now it s our participant s
turn 
Okay everyone ready 
 device beeping 
moving on to number 
For most people 
this is a simple task
that should come with
a relatively high success rate 
All right card number 
Number 
Number 
 
Our volunteers
will give us an idea
of how well the average person
identifies emotions 
And 
All right everyone 
Great work 
I hope you had fun 
Thank you for your time 
After cards 
our participants were able
to identify the correct
positive emotion
 of the time and
the correct negative emotion
 of the time 
But how well will they do
if we stop them
from mirroring the expressions
they see 
 cap pops 
By freezing their faces
with botox 
We forced all
of these participants
to receive Botox injections 
 How are you 
 I m good 
I m Dr Ali 
They were gonna do it anyway 
and they let us tag along
in the name of science 
 What areas were you looking
to get done 
 Um I d like to do this area 
 Okay okay 
 I would like to fix this part
between my two eyebrows 
because I feel like 
I just look older and grumpy 
 Although we communicate
a ton of information
with our faces in the interest
of looking younger 
many people pay to be injected
with a chemical
that essentially renders
our faces mute 
or rather gives us a sort
of facial speech impediment 
Botox was first used
in the s
to treat muscular eye disorders
like crossed eyes
and uncontrollable blinking 
The FDA didn t approve
the use of Botox
for cosmetic procedures
until 
The active ingredient in Botox
is a toxin
produced by the bacterium
Clostridium botulinum 
This toxin can cause botulism
in larger amounts 
but in smaller amounts
when injected into say 
the wrinkles between your
eyebrows or around your mouth 
the toxin blocks the nerves
from delivering signals
to the facial muscles 
telling them to contract 
 bell tings 
 Pull your hair back
a little bit 
 And then tell me what areas
you were thinking
of getting it done 
 So I was thinking here 
 cause I have a couple wrinkles
that are starting to show 
 I m years old 
and I want to get Botox because
I want to look young forever 
 Common expressions
that people want to get rid of
is the angry lines the furrows
we get in between the eyes 
And the horizontal wrinkles
we get in our forehead 
that will go away 
 If the Botox procedure
prevents these patients
from being able to mirror
the facial expressions
of others 
will it also impede
their ability to recognize
the emotions associated
with those expressions 
 Have you had Botox before 
 I never have 
 Do you wanna touch everything 
 If we can yeah 
 Yeah definitely 
I think Botox is probably
going to change my expressions
and I might have to overdo them
but I already do that anyway 
so I think that it won t matter
so much 
 You doing okay 
 We ll soon explore
whether paralyzing
their facial muscles affects
how these patients score
on the facial recognition test 
 You may not see the results
for at least
three to seven days 
 Oh yeah Okay 
 We ll check back in
with our subjects in two weeks
after they ve settled
into their new 
expression free faces 
In the meantime 
let s meet two people
who ve had modified faces
for quite a while 
Lacy Justin welcome 
 Hi How are you 
 Great to see you guys 
It s nice to meet you 
 Thanks for coming over 
 Good to see you 
So I m so thrilled
to have both of you here 
How does it feel to be known
as the Ken and Barbie
of real life 
 I don t know the world
just pinned me as that 
and then I happened to meet
my best bestie
that is Ken 
 And what about you 
Did you intend to be
like a Ken doll or 
 No I mean initially 
initially this all had to do
with the passion that I had for 
like body sculpture right 
I just did what I loved 
and I saw this as a medium
to be to be creative 
to be open 
to be expressive 
and to be different 
right to set myself apart 
So I m the first person
in the world to have
three piece shoulder implants 
We are the first people
to try that right 
We re own guinea pigs 
We re our own 
 We create them 
 We re our own
Dr Frankenstein
and Frankenstein right 
 Okay so have both of you
had Botox done 
 Every every three months
since I ve been years old 
 How has Botox
or other procedures on your face
affected your ability
to make facial expressions 
 I waited a year to have it
this year so I could actually
see a little bit of my own face 
because my kids are like 
Mom you know we can t
really tell if you re mad at us 
You always look like
you re surprised 
I m like walking
around the house like this 
I m like Ohh 
So I haven t had Botox
in a year
just because I wanted
to be able to do this 
Go to your room No 
Do you feel like
you ve lost something
by not being able to show
when you re mad 
 I don t know
what you re talking about 
 Well when you look at me now 
you can tell I m smiling 
I just don t have
the lines here 
It s a bit
of a subtle change 
 Have you noticed Botox
affecting your ability
to read other people s
facial expressions 
 My answer would be no 
 No It s actually 
 You haven t noticed that 
 Not at all 
 Barbie and Ken
may not ascribe
to the facial mirroring theory 
but let s check back
with our Botox recipients 
It s been two weeks 
and now they ve brought
their wrinkle free faces back
to see if their
limited expressions
will affect their ability
to read emotions 
So to refresh you on the rules 
look at the eyes 
determine what emotion
is being conveyed 
write down your answer 
and then we ll move on
to the next one 
 suspenseful music 
 My face feels
a lot more relaxed 
And it s it s kind of nice 
 Okay slide number 
 device beeps 
 When I look at people 
they don t really know
that I m angry 
 I actually can t 
 I did have a friend 
um she noticed 
She gets Botox too 
and she was like 
Your Botox looks amazing 
 If I m angry 
probably how you would know
is by my eye contact with you 
 Because I can t move
my forehead 
 This subject has definitely
limited her ability
to make a facial expression 
as have our other
Botox recipients 
But will that affect how they
interpret emotions in others 
All right just more 
 women scoff 
Kidding 
That s the end of the exam 
In our pre Botox study 
our participents identified
 of the positive emotions
and of the negative
emotions correctly 
But after Botox 
our participents
correctly identified only 
of the positive emotions
and 
of the negative emotions 
So at least
in our modest sample 
once our participents
lost their ability to frown
they found it
especially difficult
to identify negative emotions
in others 
But if modern advances
like Botox can impede
our capacity
to read other s faces 
can other forms of technology
enhance our ability
to see emotions 
Author and theoretical
neurobiologist Mark Changizi
has developed a scientific way
to read facial expressions 
Mark I m glad you came over 
because you have knowledge
about facial expressions
and what s going on
beyond just the more obvious
external stuff 
Is blood flow part
of facial expressions 
 Yeah so we don t
usually think about it 
but at all times you re seeing
these subtle modulations
of color 
And as you get more blood
or less blood under the skin 
it becomes bluer or yellower 
and as it becomes more
or less oxygenated 
it becomes redder or greener 
And this is true independent
of what ethnicity you are 
what race you are 
or what kind of primate you are 
It s the same 
 What emotions correlate
to what colors 
 Well there s a rough sense
in which when you re angry 
you re showing
oxygenated blood 
When you re sad 
it s more likely
to be showing greener 
If you re fearful 
your blood pumps away
from the periphery 
that it gets yellower 
 So Mark you ve brought
some tools with you 
an invention of yours 
actually that helps us
better perceive
these color changes 
 That s right so these
are what paramedics wear
 cause they re nice 
protective eyewear
that they should
be wearing anyway 
and when you wear these 
your veins 
suddenly they re glowing
The same technology that helps
paramedics see veins
also allows you
to see emotions better
because it s enhancing
that same oxygenation signal
that those emotions rely upon 
 So you ve got glasses
that allow us
to better see the colors
that are related to emotion
and how it s affected
by blood flow 
This is not the kind of thing 
it s not like you look
and it says angry 
written across the screen 
No it works on your
normal intuitions 
The idea is that it makes
those signals easier to see 
so it should give you
more insight
into what their mood 
what their intent is 
 Whether through technology
or evolution 
we humans have always found
a way to read
and use facial expressions 
And those expressions
show no sign
of becoming less important 
unless we evolve past
having faces of course 
So did you like the show 
If you didn t 
put a pencil in your mouth
and go watch it again 
If you enjoy it more
or less or the same 
just let us know 
Science will thank you 
﻿♪
I think therefore I am 
But am I 
I think Ha 
A single microscopic brain cell
cannot think 
is not conscious 
but if you bring in
a few more brain cells 
and a few more 
and connect them all 
at a certain point 
the group itself will
be able to think
and experience emotions
and have opinions
and a personality
and know that it exists 
How can such astonishing things
be made from
such simple ingredients 
Well answering that question
means learning not only who
we are 
but more importantly 
how we are 
Today using what
neuroscientists know so far 
I am going to make my hometown
function like a brain 
 all cheering applauding 
A single brain cell is tiny 
both in size and abilities 
But when enough are together 
they can do amazing things
like be aware of themselves 
When the collective power
of a group working together
is greater than the sum
of their individual parts 
that is called emergence 
In a similar fashion 
we as individuals
are connected to
the people around us 
Those connections
form communities that 
when functioning properly 
can work together
to accomplish amazing feats 
A great example is
wisdom of the crowds 
Even if not a single person
in a crowd
knows the right answer
to a question 
collectively they could all
somehow know the right answer 
In economist
Jack Treynor
conducted
the Bean Jar experiment 
He asked students
to guess the number
of jellybeans in a jar 
Now as you can probably guess 
not a single one of them
guessed the right answer 
But amazingly when he took
the average of their guesses 
what he got was a number within
just of the real answer 
Now some people
guessed way too high 
but others guessed
way too low 
so all together 
their errors balanced out 
and from a whole bunch
of wrong guesses 
the true answer emerged 
What else can a crowd do 
If I got a bunch
of humans together
and had each one of them
act like a brain cell 
turning on or off in response
to the actions of other people 
could I make a neural network
like the one in our brain 
And if I had enough people 
could intelligence emotions 
a mind emerge 
If I recruited
every single person
in the country of China
and arranged them like neurons 
would the result not only be
a simple brain 
but something that can think
and feel
and be aware of
its own existence 
Well this is the China Brain
thought experiment 
first proposed by Lawrence Davis
and later Ned Block 
It s never been done before
and well unfortunately 
I don t have access
to everyone in China 
I made some calls 
and like a lot of them are busy 
But the first step is to see
what a crowd in real life
could even do 
This hasn t been done
successfully before 
but I want to blow
a neural network
up to the scale of a crowd 
And what better crowd to use
than one made of the people
whose emergent properties
made me who I am today 
That s right I am going home
to Stilwell Kansas 
 birds chirping 
For help designing the brain
we would make out of people 
I recruited Chris Eliasmith 
director of the Center
for Theoretical Neuroscience
at the University of Waterloo 
So Chris 
we re headed south 
going down to
the heart of Stilwell 
 where I grew up 
 Nice 
We re going to do something
a little bit weird Um 
I want to create a brain 
 OK But with
a crowd of people 
It sounds like a challenge 
for sure 
I looked into it 
and I found that the roundworm
has a brain
that s made up of only
 some odd neurons 
 We can get people 
and where better to get
these people to make a brain
than my hometown of Stilwell 
This was the community
made me who I am 
This is all downtown Stilwell 
Some of my earliest memories
are from here 
This used to be 
and maybe still is 
a feed store 
and they would have sno cones
during the summer 
It was the most awesome 
delicious thing ever 
But as you can see 
a lot of corn
is grown in Kansas 
but around here the main thing
that I saw being grown
 was just sod 
Yeah There s a famous sod farm
around here
whose slogan was
High on grass 
 Chris laughs 
 It was pretty pretty edgy
for the time 
OK so back to the brain
that we re gonna make 
You know building brains is
in my job description 
I wrote a book called
How to Build a Brain 
Chris is known for
is neural network 
the Semantic Pointer
Architecture Unified Network 
or SPAUN which is one of
the world s most complex
computer simulations
It uses million
simulated neurons
to perform functions
like counting reasoning 
and image recognition 
SPAUN is cutting edge 
but neural networks
are nothing new 
The first was made
by Dr Frank Rosenblatt
of Cornell University in 
His network called
the Perceptron 
was designed for
image recognition 
and he hoped it would become
capable of learning 
just like a brain 
But the project was only
partially successful 
and after some controversy 
fell by the wayside 
It was only when researchers
in the s
came back upon
Dr Rosenblatt s work 
and as computing power
increased 
that the field of artificial
neural networks
came back to the mainstream 
Today it is alive and well 
SPAUN and even neural networks
used in self driving cars 
are expanding the possibilities
of computer learning 
If I want to make
a brain out of people 
where do I start 
That s a good question 
I think the first thing
we want to do is figure out
what we want our brain to do 
I would recommend
something like vision 
Vision Let s make
this brain see 
Before we can design
the intricacies
of the brain we re making 
let s look at how
visual processing works 
Let s say we look at a cat 
Light information
from every point on the cat
lands on the retina 
This information gets sent
to our visual cortex 
The visual cortex
is structured in layers 
V through V 
Each of these layers
are made up of neurons
activated by specific features 
like lines angles and shapes 
The features that are detected
are sent to
the infratemporal cortex
which puts all the pieces
of the image together 
and we get our Eureka moment
where we recognize
the object we re looking at 
what it means what feelings
we have towards it 
I love cats 
But what should we have
our brain recognize 
We don t want
really high resolution images
or images that depend
on too much detail 
 Ok 
 so things like letters
and digits 
Let s say we use digits Ok 
 I want to be the one
who draws a digit 
and then you will be
on the output side 
You should be able
to determine what I ve drawn 
not because I showed it
to someone and they
telephoned it back to you 
but because
they processed it
intelligently 
That s what we need
to figure out 
how we re gonna
show an input to our people 
So we should take
some small number of them
and put them at the front 
as the retina 
and really just show them each
a little bit of the image 
So if for instance 
we re able to put like
 people in that kind
of front row 
the input layer 
then whatever image we show
should be made up
of pixels 
 Exactly Right 
 Twenty five pieces 
I m gonna draw
 people 
 
 
 
 
See I can count 
These are our retina cells 
and each one is
an individual person
that s literally standing 
like in a field 
What do they then do next 
They merely need to indicate
their cell is on or off 
 So they should start firing 
They should start spiking
like a neuron 
What could they do
to indicate
that they re firing or not 
They could jump up and down 
they could wave a flag 
OK I like that 
When Chris and I use words
like firing and spiking 
we re talking about
how brain cells neurons 
talk to one another
by sending an electric message
from one cell 
to another 
an action potential 
and it travels down the axon
of the cell 
When the ionic flow
into a brain cell
reaches a certain threshold 
the cell will fire an electronic
message down its axon 
So a neuron
can either be on or off 
It s either firing
or it s not firing 
What we need to find
is a way for a person
to be either on or off 
raising a flag or their hand
should do the trick 
To illustrate our visual input 
I will be drawing a number
from to 
onto a grid divided
into squares or pixels 
Now each person or neuron 
will receive one pixel 
If a neuron receives
a pixel with writing on it 
it will fire 
The V layer identifies
pixels in the retinal layer
that form particular lines
in the number 
and the V layer identifies
particular combinations
of lines from V 
that form angles 
 What does V do 
 V is more sensitive to color 
We re only working with
black and white in this case 
So you re saying we won t even
need to have a V in our brain 
We re skipping V altogether 
All right sorry V 
 So we re gonna go
straight to V 
V neurons will fire
when their assigned
combinations of angles
have been detected 
the basic shape of a number
is beginning to take form 
And so actually the next one
is called IT 
 And that stands for
infratemporal cortex 
Now don t worry 
We haven t forgotten V and V 
They exist they re responsible
for higher level image
processing in our brain 
But for our demonstration 
we don t need them 
We do however need
the infratemporal cortex 
which is the final layer needed
for visual processing
in the brain we re designing 
Our IT will consist
of ten neurons
representing the numbers
 through 
They will be looking at neurons
in V 
and will only fire when their
corresponding neurons fire 
For example if one
or multiple V neurons
representing the shapes
of an fire 
the IT neuron
representing the 
will also fire 
Voila We just recognized
a number 
So what happens after
the infratemporal layer 
So after that 
I think that s where I ll be 
It s gonna be me making a
decision about what digit
I think was actually shown at
the end 
So I think we re gonna need
a couple hundred people 
so one question is 
where do you put
that many people 
I would love to use
my high school football field 
is it gonna work 
 I am hopeful right now 
 We got our work cut out for
us 
Michael Knowing how
we want to structure
our neural network 
it was now time for us
to head to my high school
football field
where our brain 
will take form 
I spent a lot of time here
impressing the world
with my body s prowess 
at the clarinet 
OK so Chris 
I brought you here
because we need to talk about
the actual logistics of getting
all these people together 
So here s the plan
as I see it 
Everyone is going to be
wearing a shirt
that is a different color 
based on what layer they re in 
We re also gonna give
everyone one of those um 
like I m running
in a marathon kind of 
 The big bibs 
 Bibs Thank you Yes 
I knew that too You see 
I m always checking because
Chris is one of those nerds
who doesn t know
what us sportos
talk about 
Anyway the bibs
will give every person
an individual number 
so if something goes wrong 
we can target
that one brain cell
and say Are you damaged 
What do you need 
Take out the problem 
OK we re here
on this yard line 
I will be here 
This is gonna be
the input layer 
The retinal cells will be
all in front of me 
all of them 
You are gonna be
way down in the end zone
And I m gonna be
using the scoreboard 
 Ok 
 So when you
make your prediction 
based on what you think
the brain has figured out 
we ll put that on
the Visitor s side
and I ll reveal the Home number
as what I really wrote 
 Sounds good 
 So literally from here
to that end zone
is the amount of space
we re going to need
for these hundreds of people
to also have
the right eye lines 
Just have to make sure that
communication lines are open 
meaning that it s easy to see
whoever you have to
pay attention to 
Our human brain will have
a couple hundred people
spread out in five layers
across half a football field 
Every single participant
will be assigned
to only react
to certain neurons
in the layer ahead of them 
And it s complicated 
so their positions on the field
had to be carefully chosen
so that every neuron
has a clear line of sight
to the neurons
they are connected to 
In a way 
something will be born
on this field tomorrow 
 We shall find out 
 We ll find out 
 crowd chattering 
So what does it take
to turn Stilwell into a brain 
Well seven tents chairs 
twenty gallons of coffee 
three hundred flags 
t shirt and hats 
our drone operator Jeff 
this cute little Gator 
two hundred cinnamon rolls 
and of course 
our medic Brian 
Now all that s left
is to pull this all off 
A community is something
that is bigger
that the sum
of all of its parts 
and so is a brain 
Now today I m feeling
pretty excited about
the neural network
we re gonna build out of people 
because there s a zero percent
chance of rain 
but a chance of brain 
OK we better get started 
The gates are open 
and our neurons are filing in 
First they re all given
color coded t shirts
associated with the layer of
the brain they will represent 
Just want go in the center 
And then they will
take to the field
to get in position 
You all in the orange shirts
are the retina 
Your job is to say 
Is there writing on my square 
or Not If your square
has any writing
or black marks on it 
raise your flag 
oh and stand up 
Now I m sure all you
mega brainiacs out there
remember every detail about
how this brain
is going to recognize numbers 
But just in case you don t 
here s a refresher 
I will draw a number
on a pixel grid 
break the squares up 
and hand them out
to every person
in the retina layer 
The retinal neurons
will only fire if they
have writing on their pixel 
The people in the yellow shirts 
you guys are V 
Each V neuron will be watching
three retinal neurons
in front of them
and fire only if all three
of their assigned retinal
neurons fire 
revealing lines
that make up the number 
You guys are V 
You re a bit more advanced 
You re looking for combinations
of features
that make for instance angles 
The V neurons will be watching
the V layer 
and fire only if
their assigned V neurons fire 
revealing angles 
V neurons will be
looking at V neurons 
Their firing reveals
that begin to form the number 
Finally the purple shirts 
You all are
Extremely important role 
not more important
than the others though 
Part of the IT s function
is to inhibit
incorrect results it receives
from the V layer 
For example if V neurons
are indicating
both a and an 
an will outrank a 
because an has more features 
Chris will determine the number
by interpreting the results
from the IT layer 
Got it Good Because
it s happening now 
Michael over loudspeaker 
All right 
It is time for me
to draw my first numeral 
Stand by 
Now it s time to distribute
these pixels
to the photoreceptors
in the retina 
 
 
I have distributed
the input to the retina layer 
Is everyone ready 
Three two 
one think 
And they re off 
The retina layer has fired 
passing off signals to V 
V sees V firing 
and also fires 
cuing V and IT 
There s a lot of flags
on the play folks 
Look at all this processing 
Good work stay up 
I m now walking back to Chris
where he will tell me
what you guys have processed 
All right Chris 
it actually happened
way faster than I thought 
It took me forever
to get over here 
They were already done
thinking 
It was really interesting
to watch 
We had a little bit of noise
in the system for sure 
because we actually kind of
have two answers at the end 
So I m going to be doing
something that brains do 
which is kind of
make a guess sometimes
based on the best evidence 
All right Chris 
What numeral
do you think I drew 
Chris 
I think you drew a 
Let s get that up
on the Visitor s scoreboard 
The numeral I truly drew 
was a 
Nice work 
There was some noise
in the system 
I think we can perfect this
because it wasn t
a confident 
but Chris did still
get it right 
And by Chris 
I mean all of you 
We gave each of our IT neurons
a clear tube and plastic balls
to make their job easier 
Every time they see one of the
neurons they re watching fire 
they put a ball in their tube 
If a neuron
they re inhibited by
has more balls than they do 
they stop firing 
Our model had a mistake 
You should have been
inhibited by 
meaning that if is firing 
and puts a ball in the tube 
 you just sit down 
But we didn t have 
written down into your code 
I m gonna do that right now 
With that kink worked out 
it was time to try again 
Take that one 
 
Three two one 
go 
Ooh There s not much happening
in V and V 
Or IT for that matter 
Looks like our brain died 
Something definitely
went wrong 
The processing stopped in V 
So I think our brain broke 
Not a single person in V 
or the infratemporal cortex
has been activated 
Chris Seems like something
very strange happened
when the light
went through the lens
and got to the retina 
OK but what you really mean to
say is that I handed the pixels
out to the wrong neurons 
 It s lookin that way 
 Wow who would have thought
that the worst working
part of the machine
would be the actual people
who get to be people
 and not brain cells 
 I know right 
OK I think
I m gonna do an this time 
And I m gonna put it
kind of up in this corner 
or along that side 
This is pretty weird 
it s not centered 
it s not filling up
the whole space 
Let s see if our brain
can recognize it 
Each pixel of our image
needs to go
to a particular retinal neuron 
To make sure I didn t
mess it up again 
we put numbers
on the back of each one 
 all cheer 
Three two one go 
Whoa 
That was fast 
Blink and you ll miss it 
so let s take a break 
because this is the Mind Field
Play of the Game 
The I drew contained
 pixels 
and bam the retinal cells
connected to those locations
are firing 
Now that s what I call
a sensation 
V reads the formation
perfectly 
They don t even know it 
but each one firing
means a horizontal vertical 
or diagonal line
has been caught 
Now look at neuron s speed 
It s sensitive only to
a horizontal line
low and to the right 
which my had 
If retinal cells and 
all fire together 
such a line has been sensed 
and watch this boom 
Champion reflexes there 
folks 
If the V neurons
a V player is watching fire 
they stand and that means
that the lines V caught
made some corner angle 
Standing V neurons are shapes
made by those corners 
but it all comes down to IT 
A bunch of them fire 
Lots of numbers contain
the shapes I drew 
but there can only be
one MVP 
and dang 
look at this teamwork 
 is inhibited by 
 is inhibited by 
If is getting
this much activity 
sit down
and let that neuron score 
This my friends is what
we in the cognition sports biz
call a gr play 
Chris over loudspeaker 
The purple people neurons
make me think that
you wrote an 
An Let s put an 
up on the scoreboard 
the numeral that I did write 
was an 
 Nice job 
 That was good 
This was our first
definitive success 
Now it s time to really
put the system to the test 
So I m gonna draw a 
but then I m gonna add
a line down here
and I m gonna do
a dot right there 
And we re gonna see if
that noise trips up our brain 
My guess is a 
The number that I drew was 
in fact a 
 cheers applause 
 and I m gonna put
a line through it 
Go 
Man these people are good 
The brain thinks
it s just saw a 
I wrote a 
 cheers applause 
 Nice work 
With two successful
results in a row 
for the last test
I want to see what will happen
if I really
mess with our brain 
I m not even going to draw
a number 
instead I m going to
fill in every single cell 
This means that
every single neuron
in the retina will fire 
will stand up and wave 
Let s see what happens 
My prediction of course 
it s gonna look like an 
because an is a numeral that
fills in a lot of the cells 
Are you all ready 
 Chris are you ready 
 Ready 
All right I m ready 
What 
 laughing 
 all cheering 
 Michael Look at that 
 Michael Holy cow 
It looks to me like you
essentially opened up the eye
and shone a laser
right into it 
Right yeah 
So what I did is 
I didn t even draw a numeral 
I just scribbled
all over the whole thing 
I filled in every single cell 
 So what does the brain
think that I drew 
 The 
I had no idea the inhibition
would work that well 
We were able to single
all of that mess
down into just one guess 
and it really was
the smartest guess 
Right it was the one with
the most features in it 
Congratulations to
the entire infratemporal cortex 
V V V retina 
You guys have been amazing 
Today I was a neuron 
My favorite part
was that it actually worked 
was just the whole experience 
doing science 
meeting cool people 
It s just a really good
simulation of how
the brain works 
and it was just really cool
to take some information
from that 
thanks for being a brain 
 all cheer 
Our small town brain
did work as predicted 
Made up of only
a couple hundred neurons 
each one with no idea
what number I was drawing 
it was nonetheless able
to process the image
and determine
the correct answer 
We created a living 
breathing model
of a part of the human brain 
And our demonstration
was a new way
to illustrate and share
how the human brain
processes visual information 
We were able to watch it
process think 
in real time 
and that s amazing 
Its success shows what we can
achieve by working together 
and we only used
a small fraction
of the number of neurons found
in an actual human brain 
So imagine how powerful
the connections of
not a few hundred 
but a hundred billion
human neurons could be 
Now interestingly 
a hundred billion people
is about how many humans
have ever existed
in the history of Earth 
There are only a few billion
alive right now 
so I guess that means
get procreating please 
I want to make a bigger
superhuman mind 
No I d like to thank
every neuron
from my hometown of Stilwell 
and the entire community
that supported us 
Because without them
all working together 
none of this
would have been possible 
 no audible dialogue

﻿ Michael 
This is Iquitos Peru 
the world s largest city
inaccessible by road 
The only way in and out
is by air or by river 
the Amazon River 
I m about to head up the Amazon
to a remote jungle retreat
called Refugio Altiplano 
the Refuge on the Higher Plain 
There I will meet
with local shamans
to drink an ancient
psychedelic drug ayahuasca 
Ayahuasca contains
dimethyltryptamine DMT 
a molecule shaped
very similar to serotonin 
a neurotransmitter
in our brains 
Ingesting ayahuasca and flooding
the brain with DMT
leads to what many describe
as spiritual experiences 
strong vivid visions 
a sense of oneness
with the universe 
even a sense
of one s self dying 
But mystical 
magical language like that
doesn t really seem relevant
to scientific inquiry 
It can often scare away those
who are scientifically minded 
However an understanding
of the human mind
isn t complete unless
it considers
everything the brain
is capable of 
What does it mean to feel
at one with the universe 
Why should our brains even
be capable of such a feeling 
This isn t about having fun
or taking a risk
or doing something extreme 
I want to learn
what my mind is capable of 
I m about to embark
on a journey 
Psychedelics are chemicals
that are structurally similar
to neurotransmitters
already used by our brains 
When we ingest them 
they bind to receptors
and alter cognition
and perception
in ways we re still trying
to understand 
When many people think
of psychedelics 
they think about people
challenging societal norms
and recreational
thrill seekers 
but that only attends
to a particularly narrow slice
of human history and culture 
Fossil records cave drawings 
and archaeological digs
have all provided evidence
that humans
have been using
psychedelic compounds
for thousands of years and
by used I don t just mean
in the stereotypical
trip out sense 
 screaming 
among the indigenous peoples
of the Amazon rainforest 
psychedelics were and 
in many places still are
a normal common 
and totally
mainstream experience 
As a member of these groups 
believing psychedelics can heal 
give visions of the future 
and connect you with deities
is not some weird
or New Age idea 
It s the way things are 
But when psychedelics
became associated
with certain
counterculture movements 
the United States banned
research on them in 
Most other countries followed
suit shortly afterwards 
From then on testing on humans
was essentially gone 
but recently restrictions
have begun to loosen up 
and a few researchers
have started
to investigate these substances
in what some have described
as a psychedelic renaissance 
Research universities
are conducting
comprehensive studies
on the beneficial effects
of psychedelics on addiction 
depression 
and cancer related trauma 
By approaching
psychedelics scientifically 
what we find could
fundamentally transform
our understanding
of the human mind 
 trimmer buzzing 
When I go to Peru 
I will be accompanied
by Dr Robin Carhart Harris 
one of the first
British researchers
in over years
to investigate the effects
of psychedelics
on the human mind 
He and his colleagues
have found that psychedelics
don t increase brain activity 
as previously thought 
Instead they decrease activity
in certain areas 
And the greater the decrease 
the greater
the reported feelings
of what is called
ego dissolution or ego death 
Your ego is your self identity 
It s the part that separates
you from everything else 
the part
that creates narratives about
the outside world
and your story in it 
When the ego dissolves 
your sensations
and feelings don t cease
like when you re unconscious 
Instead your attachment
to your identity does 
and all that s left
is naked perception 
Ego dissolution is a concept
that I find difficult
to wrap my head around 
but people who take psychedelics
say that it can be
an extremely
frightening experience 
but also a profoundly
transformative one 
one that makes them feel
more connected
to others and to nature 
Now I knew that I might feel
ego dissolution on ayahuasca 
so to make sure I was ready 
I decided to speak
to some experts 
Before setting off to Peru 
Dr Carhart Harris traveled
from Imperial College London 
to meet with me 
This will be one
of the first times
that anyone has scanned
a healthy person s brain
with FMRI before
and after ayahuasca 
 It s quite pioneering work 
The thing that s on my mind
right now is intention 
 I ve heard you should know why
you re drinking ayahuasca 
Yeah I would suggest
that you think
about an emotional intention 
To make it emotional is
a lot more frightening to me 
 Partly I think I m quite happy 
and I don t want
to ruin that right 
I don t want to drink
ayahuasca and then
think Oh my gosh 
I m not close enough
to my mom 
or I don t show my wife
I appreciate her enough 
and now
I just feel terrible 
There s something to be said
for sitting with those thoughts 
 being mindful of them 
And in so doing 
they become less of a threat 
 You look them in the eye 
All of a sudden 
they reveal things to you 
and their scariness
seems to dissipate 
I hope I can embrace
that while I m surrounded
by people who are
all filming me you know 
Yeah the most important thing
is that intention to go in 
 You dive in 
in and through 
 You don t resist 
You don t resist 
Yeah I think that ll
really be important
while I m on the trip 
 Michael Robin has
arranged for a number
of scientific tests
to be done in order to measure
brain activity 
behavioral differences 
and physiological changes
to my brain 
 Robin Today we are scanning
Michael s brain
with functional magnetic
resonance imaging or FMRI 
This allows us to see
the whole brain
and how different parts connect
and talk to one another 
This way we can compare
how Michael s brain may change
before his experience
with ayahuasca
to after
the ayahuasca experience 
I expect to see
that one network of the brain
that relates to introspection
will become more strongly
connected after the ayahuasca 
After meeting Robin 
I still felt some trepidation
about my trip 
but with my pre ayahuasca
FMRI completed 
it was time to set off
for Peru 
The trip to the Refugio
Altiplano retreat
involved a flight
to Lima Peru 
a second flight
to Iquitos Peru 
followed by a minute
boat ride up the Amazon River 
It was a long journey 
And every minute I got closer
meant that it would be harder
to turn back 
The Refugio Altiplano retreat
is in a very remote area
of the Amazon River
in the northern part of Peru 
and I thought it would be
a great setting
for my ayahuasca experience 
So Kelly what does
the word ayahuasca mean 
Ayahuasca means
the vine of the soul 
Ayahuasca s been used
for possibly over years
in shamanic rituals
and is the primary
plant medicine
for healing in the villages 
 Michael With the ayahuasca
ceremony just hours away 
I met with José 
the shaman who would be
my guide
during this experience 
 Hola José Claudia 
 Hola amigo 
 speaking Spanish 
 translating 
It s my pleasure
to have you here 
Welcome
to Refugio Altiplano 
where many people come
to look for a change
in their lives 
José how do you
feel about someone
like me coming in 
who is not part
of your culture 
taking part in it
in a way
that might not come
from the same history 
 Claudia 
For me there s no difference 
and for the medicine 
it makes no difference 
This medicine all it wants
is to make your life better
and heal you 
On the very first night
with our guests 
we give them a very small
medicinal dose
to see how each person s
gonna react differently
to the medicine 
and then tomorrow night 
we ll dial it up a little bit 
 Michael It was great
to speak with José
about what the ceremony
will entail 
I am nervous about
the emotional part of it 
and I m nervous
about the visions and feeling
like I ve been disconnected
from the real world 
Scientists know very little
about how ayahuasca works
since its illegal status
in many countries
makes it difficult to study 
We do know that
its key ingredient
is dimethyltryptamine or DMT 
which is a hallucinogen
thought to occur naturally
in the human brain
in small amounts 
DMT can create
psychoactive effects
by acting on certain receptors
But normally DMT is broken down
rapidly by enzymes in the brain 
but ayahuasca is actually
a brew made from two plants 
One contains DMT 
and the second contains
a chemical inhibitor
that blocks our brain s ability
to break down DMT 
allowing the effects to last
as long as four hours 
Dr Carhart Harris performed
a series of tests on me
to compare how I change
 Robin 
Given that we re in Peru 
we re in the jungle 
and you re
drinking ayahuasca 
it has authenticity
that perhaps
sometimes you lose
when you give psychedelics
in the laboratory
environment 
 Because we re
going to be doing this
after you drink ayahuasca 
we need a control condition 
so what I m going to do now
is I ll ask you
a short list of questions
about your journey here 
and I want you
to rate how you feel
about these questions
on a scale here 
We have zero to nine 
Nine will be strongly agree 
and zero will be
strongly disagree 
So I learned more
from my journey here
to this retreat center
about how past events
have influenced
my present behavior 
Two 
 I got ideas areas during 
 Two 
 Five Six 
With different
psychedelic drugs to ayahuasca
like LSD and psilocybin 
also DMT 
we ve found some quite
consistent changes
in brain activity 
We ve seen
that the brain activity
is richer and more varied 
Of course 
we can t wheel an MRI scanner
up into the jungle 
so the EEG setup that we have
the best possibility
that we have to do this 
According to Jose this flower
bath was meant
to protect me from bad spirits
during the ceremony 
 Michael speaks Spanish 
 José chuckles 
I didn t believe in such
things but I was glad to do it
because it was a symbol
of José s good intentions 
Hola 
Buenas noches 
 Michael The initial
smaller dose ceremony
was expected to last
about two hours
with the effects beginning
after minutes 
 José speaking Spanish 
We ll begin
with our ceremony tonight 
asking God to guide us 
to give us knowledge
and intelligence 
We re going to bless
the medicine first 
Gracias 
The ayahuasca tasted earthy 
Maybe also a bit like fennel
It s hard to say 
I d never tasted
anything like it 
After swallowing it all 
my heart started racing 
It was the most nervous
I would be all night 
DMT from the ayahuasca
was flowing
into my blood and brain 
There was no going back 
 José chanting 
Throughout the ceremony 
shaman José is saying icaros 
or chants 
which were meant to guide me
through my spiritual
experience 
 chanting continues 
The initial dose was meant
to gently introduce me
to ayahuasca 
The effects began slowly
and were mild 
I began to feel
as though the room
were swinging like a cradle 
I was aware that the motion
wasn t really happening 
but it made me feel sick
and nervously off balance
nonetheless 
My imagination was more vivid 
Images in my mind
were more detailed 
but almost always
under my control 
The ceremony ends when
the shaman lights a candle 
I was comforted by this
because it was a sign
that the effects would
only be weakening from here 
Thank you José 
I think there were two moments
where I was actually
was surprised
by something that I saw 
One was like a very vivid 
like bamboo that had been cut
so that it was at a slant 
and I remember going 
Wow where did that come from 
 But as soon as I did 
it was gone 
 Robin One of the effects
of ayahuasca
is to kind of create
a sort of chaos in the cortex 
That can lead
to dreamlike visions 
The second time I was like 
Oh yeah nature 
and like Do I feel more
at one with everything 
And I imagined trees 
but only in this ring 
And all of a sudden 
they came really close 
and they were all
right here in my head 
But I was like 
I did not think that 
I didn t intend
for that to happen 
I think a good comparison
for what I felt last night 
if you in a sober state
of mind just imagine something 
like think of a pink elephant 
Okay now an image
probably popped into your mind 
but not like
a super detailed one 
If I asked you
a specific question like 
How many wrinkles
are on its trunk 
you d have to probably
imagine it again
and then like basically
fill in that detail 
But under the effects
of ayahuasca 
those details were already
in these 
these imagined images 
They seemed only as real
as an imagined image 
as a daydream 
but they came with more detail 
and a few times 
I d say maybe
three or four times 
things appeared that I did not
feel like I had put there 
But as soon as I was aware
of that they disappeared 
I d like to look at the stars 
Yeah let s do that 
The morning after
my initial dose of ayahuasca 
my head was clearer 
and I wanted to discuss
my experience was shaman José 
 Hola Michael 
 Hola 
You had a perfect
introduction ceremony 
Emotionally
and sort of personally 
the only sort of
revelations I had
was that I was probably
more worried
than I needed to be
beforehand
and that I let that affect
my behavior 
and now I m not
as dominated
by what might happen
or what has happened 
I m just kind of
in this moment right now 
Like I feel much more open
to mystical thinking 
He recommends
that you complete with
more medicine tonight
so that this will help you
complete
the insight into yourself 
Last night 
I had a third of a cup 
Three quarters will be
the dose for tonight 
Three quarters Okay 
It s weird 
I had an intention going in 
I experienced this
as a very interesting
scientific endeavor 
But I m fascinated by how
I want it to have meaning 
I feel like I didn t hit
that oneness yet 
Tonight might be different 
 Robin Michael s getting
the higher dose tonight 
and the experience
is very likely to differ
quite substantially
from the dose
that he had last night 
 Michael I m interested
in personal development 
I know that that s a big part
for a lot of people 
I m open to it for sure 
but I do feel still
some apprehension
for a larger dose tonight 
Hey Michael 
I m here to pick you up
for ceremony 
 Buenas noches 
The higher dose ceremony
was expected to last four hours
with stronger
and more vivid hallucinations 
José smoked a cigar
made of a tobacco plant
that s indigenous
to the Amazon called mapacho 
The smoke is believed to clean
the energy fields of the body
and remove negativity
from the ceremonial lodge 
 exhales slowly 
The second ceremony included
another shaman Daniel 
 chanting 
I started to see
these very geometric 
bright squares like 
stacked like Aztec pyramids 
moving 
and I was traveling down
through these like 
repeating kind of you know 
fractaled images of everything 
I mean too many things
to really describe 
music notes and colors
and shapes and squares 
Then I started to feel like 
this is going faster and faster 
and this is too fast 
and it hasn t even been
that long 
and then I felt my body being
covered with these blocks 
and I like 
saw my body from above
and felt like
I was disappearing 
And that s when my heart
started racing 
and I said 
Mm this was very bad 
This is not good 
A lot of emotions I always have
were amplified
so loudly
I couldn t ignore them 
And I had to come up
with ways to console myself
so that I wouldn t
be consumed by them
and have a complete breakdown
and panic attack 
And I resisted 
and I successfully
brought myself back
to calmness just by saying 
I m fine 
I m not going to die 
and everyone here can help me 
The visions were really 
really vivid 
They didn t feel like
they were under my control 
It really felt
like they were just there 
A note from the song
would occur 
and it would cause this image 
and that was pretty frightening 
because I wasn t 
I was like on a ride
that I didn t know
the path of 
 distorted chanting 
 Robin 
 I can do the EEG now 
 Yeah sure 
 Michael I spent a lot
of the ceremony being anxious
about having to do
these tests with Robin 
I don t know how to deal
with the lights coming back on
and Robin talking to me
and asking me questions 
but the more I concentrated
on why I feel anxious 
the more I realized
it was just about me 
It was about how I felt 
but then I said 
I m here to do a show 
We re filming this 
Robin wants this data 
Everyone will be happier
if I do it 
So I ll just tell Robin
I ll try my best 
the courage to do it 
So being less selfish
basically saved me
from a panic attack 
 Robin Each time
I read an item if you
could give me a number
according to how
you see yourself
at this moment okay 
I see myself right now
as extroverted 
enthusiastic 
Um one 
 Robin This is a big change
for Michael 
Usually 
he s very extroverted 
and on
his pre ayahuasca answer 
he gave a higher number 
Extroverted enthusiastic 
Five 
 Robin But now I m seeing
signs of withdrawal
and introversion from him 
as critical quarrelsome 
two 
Six 
 Robin The experience
has led to a change
in how he sees himself 
It s in a way reflective
perhaps
of a higher waking state 
 plucks notes 
It s interesting
to already see those changes 
and it s only halfway
through the ceremony 
 Daniel singing
in native language 
Shaman Daniel sang in Shipibo 
his indigenous language
spoken by only people
I ve always been frustrated
by the difficulty people had
in explaining
to have a psychedelic
Now I know why 
It s a different
state of mind 
and trying to describe that
is like trying to describe
anger to someone
who has never felt it
or what colors are like
to a blind person 
 singing continues 
I d say about five minutes
into that first song 
I 
really panicked 
My heart rate picked up 
and I actually touched my chest
to make sure it wasn t beating
as fast as I thought it was 
But that moment 
I may have left my body
or something near it
before I stopped 
I was very scared
that I was disappearing 
Michael is describing
what to me sounds like
quintessential ego dissolution 
the start of it 
that feeling
that he s disappearing 
that his control over his mind
and his body
is ceding entirely 
and he felt
some resistance to that 
With a high enough dose 
you re just forced
into that space 
My feeling is that
the intensity of his experience
was just short of that
kind of profound
transformative type experience 
I think he got a bit of that 
but I don t think
he was all the way 
 Michael I was there
in that ego dissolving state
for a moment 
and it terrified me 
I wish I was able
to surrender more fully 
but I definitely
got a good taste of it 
So the dosage last night
was much higher 
Visions 
the visuals were really vivid 
and the feeling of strangeness
was really strong 
I d be curious to know
what José was doing last night 
What was he reacting to
that he saw in me 
What plants did he call forth
and why 
He knew you were going through
an intense ceremony 
It was strong for you 
But he said he was very happy
because he knew
this was going to have
a positive ending for you 
I m really interested
in what the lessons were 
I felt so small 
and so humble 
But but honestly I liked it 
I wasn t afraid of it 
I was glad to be reminded
that I m weak 
I feel like the experience
amplified
everything I m concerned about
way above what would be
a normal amount
to care about it 
But that made my fear
and anxiety big enough
that I could actually
relax them 
will I remember to apply that 
or will this kind of stay
in the jungle 
Before leaving Peru 
I completed one last round
of tests with Robin 
I ll place this
on your head 
 in order to gather data
after my higher dose
of ayahuasca 
I can t wait to see you
back in L A 
and see what other thoughts
you ve had with these tests 
 Robin Being here in
the jungle it s more organic 
Because of that 
I feel that I ve collected data
that s going to tell us
something important
and meaningful
about how psychedelics
and ayahuasca specifically
work on the mind and the brain 
After returning home
to Los Angeles 
I had my second MRI
so that Robin could see
if there were any changes 
Although my ego dissolved
only for a brief few moments 
I was teetering on that edge
throughout the entire ceremony 
and I was anxious to see what
it looked like in my brain 
Robin welcome to my home 
Thank you for coming back 
I can t wait to see
what results you got 
 How did ayahuasca
affect my brain 
Okay so we found
something quite interesting 
We found that your brain
activity became more complex 
more diverse more rich 
more varied
under the ayahuasca
than at baseline 
What does it mean to have
more complex brain activity
in terms of how
I experience things 
Mm I think
we can understand it in terms
of the richness of your
imagination of your ideas 
Trains of thought
can be more varied 
more changeable 
more dynamic 
 I definitely experienced that 
All right you looked
not just at my brain
through the surface 
but you went deep inside 
 What did you notice there 
We looked at a particular
brain network
called the default mode network
that seems to relate
to our sense of self or ego 
We ve seen in other studies
that during
a psychedelic experience 
that network
is dramatically compromised 
It shows a kind
of disintegration and actually 
that process relates
quite strongly
to people s ego dissolution 
and yet after the experience 
the network comes back
as a kind of reset
or a kind of rebooting
of the network 
and what we found your brain
after ayahuasca 
as predicted was
that your brain reset 
The network
became more cohesive 
more integrated more strongly
connected within itself 
Wow Yeah afterwards 
I really did feel
much more interested
with my identity my past
and my future 
 You asked me a lot of questions
about my insight
into experiences 
 How did those compare 
Well actually we saw something
really nice in those data 
So your ratings of insight
for the journey 
the lower dose and then
the higher dose with ayahuasca 
what we saw was that
there was a graded increase
in your levels of insight 
Your score at baseline
was 
After the low dose experience 
it was 
After the high dose ceremony 
it was 
Wow I definitely felt
like the larger
the ayahuasca dose 
the more I considered
 and learned about myself 
Well Robin 
I m glad that we were able
to do such a you know 
in the environment type study 
So thank you for coming all
the way out to Peru with me 
I really appreciate it 
and I hope that I helped 
Yeah it s been
and I ve learned a lot 
As I look back on it now 
I feel like my experience
was one of resistance 
Instead of surrendering myself
to its effects 
I dipped in
and then got scared 
and I told myself 
It ll be all right 
I m not gonna die 
but I should ve just gone in
and through 
I did however learn a lot
about how to control anxiety 
that relinquishing control
and selfishness
can make it vanish 
but perhaps in doing so 
I lost the chance to experience
my mind operating
without the controls
and dampening
I m so used to that
I m more comfortable with 
Scientists like Robin
have managed to break through
tight legal restrictions
surrounding these substances
and have begun to find out
what they can teach us
about the mind 
Their findings so far
are just the beginning
of our understanding
of these powerful compounds 
which shows us how much
we have yet to learn
about the mind and brain 
 theme music playing
﻿ So welcome everyone 
My name s Ron and your task
is to choose
the line on the right
that matches the line
on the left 
 All right this seems like
an easy enough task 
which line on the right
is the same length
as the one on the left 
The answer is clearly three 
 One 
 Why is everyone saying one 
Are their eyes not working 
Have we just discovered
some new type of illusion 
No the answer is 
we paid them to lie 
Today we are going
to be demonstrating
a very famous
psychological experiment
known as the Asch experiment 
tests conformity
and whether or not a person
will say something incorrect
simply because everyone else is 
What matters more 
Being right or fitting in 
 calm music 
We have five
professional actors
that have been instructed
to do as we say 
Often they will be lying
about what they think
the answer is 
But in position number five 
a real participant
who has no idea
what s going on
will be seated 
Now their task is to match
the length of the line
on the left with one
of the lines on the right 
But what if everyone else
in the room
gave the wrong answer 
Would you be bold enough
to stick out
and say what you saw 
or would you just fit in
because it s easier
or less uncomfortable 
Well let s find out 
 So welcome everyone 
My name s Ron 
Your task is to choose
I ll just call on you
individually 
you know in order 
one through six 
 The calm before the storm 
 Okay so let s begin 
 The first few times 
we re gonna have the actors
say the correct answer
to gain the trust
of our subject 
The correct answer here
is three 
 Three 
 Number three 
 Number one 
 Now they re all
gonna start lying 
The correct answer is three 
our subject does 
 Pretty quickly she appears
to be confused 
 Um okay number one 
 Three 
 tense music 
 You can see participant five
closing one eye 
then the other 
trying to figure out
why everyone s wrong 
But she s not going
along with them 
Again the correct answer
 bell dings Let s see what
 Yeah number one 
 Three 
 She s sticking to her guns 
but she appears
to be uncomfortable
opposing the group 
This time 
the correct answer is two 
 She s falling in line 
Will she do it again 
 Conformed 
Conformity 
The desire to fit in 
Peer pressure 
These are powerful
social forces
that shape our actions
and influence how we behave
as individuals
and as a society 
In the original
Asch experiments
first carried out by
Solomon Asch in 
approximately of subjects
conformed at least once 
 Hi Ron 
Sorry to butt in guys 
I just wanted to kind of ask you
a few questions
about the study
you ve been doing 
This is a study on conformity 
And everyone in this room
is an actor 
except for you number five 
 Oh my God 
Oh my God 
This is so crazy 
 And they ve all
been instructed
to give the wrong answers
to see if you ll follow along 
 Whoa 
 You did say the wrong answer
after everyone else had
said the wrong answer 
Why did you do it 
 I thought There s something
I don t know what to do 
so I m just gonna
say what they said 
 How did it feel to do that 
 It it felt 
it felt like I was
drinking the Kool Aid like 
 It s very normal 
This study wouldn t be
as famous as it was
if it wasn t normal 
though it is surprising 
because so many of us would say 
No I would always
say what s real 
 Right Right 
 Would you 
 Right no 
Clearly not all the time yeah 
 upbeat synth music 
People follow the crowd in
all kinds of interesting ways 
many of which are pretty funny 
Classical psychological
and hidden camera pranks
often involve people acting
together in strange ways
to see if others will conform 
Now there s nothing
inherently irrational
about following the crowd
in ways like those 
Conforming can be a form
of social lubrication 
It s just easier to do what
someone else is doing 
because to break from that norm
would be to slow things down 
If everyone s facing
the same way in an elevator 
it s not like you lose your
personal sense of identity
by turning along with them 
Instead you re just
going with the flow
and not being awkward 
If I see a bunch of people
on the street looking up 
and I decide to look up too 
there s nothing
inherently bad about that 
I mean what it costs
for me to look up
is really low compared
to the potential harm
that might come from me
not seeing an imminent threat 
Sometimes conformity
is harmless 
Even laughter is a form
of conformity 
We laugh if something is funny 
but we also tend to laugh
if people around us
are laughing 
even if we don t get the joke 
There are a lot of social
forces behind this 
politeness 
a fear of looking stupid 
and no doubt a desire
to conform 
to fit in 
Let s see what happens when
there s even more pressure
to see something that s unfunny
as hilarious 
We ve invited these people
to participate in
a psychological experiment 
But here s the thing 
everyone in this room
is an actor 
except this guy 
He thinks he s just killing time
in this waiting room
before the experiment begins 
But this is the experiment 
and that s no joke 
Hey how s everyone doing today 
 indistinct murmuring 
My name s Michael 
Nice to meet you all 
Thanks for participating 
It s important that everyone
be kind of in a chatty mood 
So here s a question 
anyone got some good jokes 
 I have a great one 
 Oh yeah 
 Why did the hipster burn
his mouth on coffee 
Because he drank it
way before it was cool 
Get it yeah 
 I get it yeah 
 Our subject thinks
the real joke is funny 
but keep in mind 
the joke I m going to tell
is complete nonsense 
It s not funny 
It s just words 
Everyone but the subject has
been instructed to laugh at it 
will the pressure to conform
make the subject laugh 
Okay how about this one 
Uh a giraffe is at the airport
going through the TSA line 
And the security agent says 
Hey is this your laptop 
And the giraffe says 
I thought you d never ask 
 You guys have never
heard that before 
 No never 
 It s pretty famous 
 I didn t 
 This is a classic example
Even when the crowd acts
in a way that makes no sense 
the need to fit in
is still very strong 
Uh two penguins are
driving in a car 
The driver says Hey could you
change the radio station 
And the other one says 
No radio Four wheels 
 That was better 
 Laughter can be a powerful
tool for social conformity 
which is exactly why sitcoms
use canned laughter 
 How do you feel about
courtin right now 
 Uncle Jake if there
was a pretty girl
on the other side of this house 
I d jump clean over it 
 The laugh track
entices you at home
to laugh along 
even when a joke
might not be that funny 
So will our other subjects
feel compelled to laugh
at our meaningless joke 
So a giraffe is at the airport 
And it s in the security line 
and the TSA agent says 
Is this your laptop 
I thought you would never ask 
 Since our subjects are
in a conforming mood 
 Let s take this
a step further 
 Hey I need Katie and Lauren
to come with me
for your interview 
 Let s see how committed
they are to fitting in 
Will they repeat
the nonsensical joke
to another one of our actors 
 We were telling jokes earlier 
Should I say the uh 
 The giraffe Okay 
So 
 Hey uh Tim I need you
 Okay Good 
 inaudible 
 I guess the joke has to wait 
 Yeah Dude you tell it 
You tell it bro 
 Well 
 No you got it You got it 
Say it 
 Okay so the giraffe
is in a line 
in a TSA line 
 Waiting 
 And the 
and the agent asks him 
Is that your laptop 
And he was like 
 percussive beat 
 I don t I don t get it 
 Yeah it s gonna take you
a while to get it 
 And he says um 
 What s the funny part 
 I don t know 
I I found it funny 
And it s a giraffe 
It s not a human 
 And you thought it was funny 
 What was the funny part 
though 
Like 
 I think it was 
the funny part was the laptop 
 cause you know how
he s so tall 
 Do these subjects
really think
my meaningless joke is funny 
It s time to let them in
on what s really going on 
Everyone here today
except for you is an actor 
 We have all been instructed
to laugh at that
dumb giraffe joke 
which is not even a joke 
It s just a meaningless thing 
And then we see if the one
person who isn t in on it 
which in this round was you 
how they respond 
Why did you never say 
 I think it was people
laughing around me 
and I was trying to understand
why that was funny 
And then I had to make sense
of it in my mind 
and then I think I made it
funny to myself 
 That process
of mental gymnastics
cognitive dissonance 
When you ve done something
you don t truly believe in 
like laughing just because
everyone else did 
you try to come to terms
with your behavior
through denial
and justification 
It s not a joke I just made
that up and it s nonsense 
 I know that s why
I thought it was funny 
 Cause it just would 
make no sense 
 Yeah that s why 
That s crazy though 
 cause it did make me laugh 
 Everyone does that 
 It s typical human behavior 
 Yeah It s true though 
 To go with the flow
and to keep things moving 
It s about just being
a good social person 
 It s definitely a 
a conformity thing 
 One of the most disappointing
and terrifying aspects
of our desire not to stand out
is the bystander effect 
People are less likely
to help victims
if other people are around 
One of the most famous examples
is told in Psych classes
all over the world 
It s the story
of Kitty Genovese 
a woman who was brutally stabbed
and raped in New York City
in 
 It was a murder
that symbolized
the apathy of many
to big city crime 
On a March night
back in 
 year old bar manager
Kitty Genovese
was stabbed to death
on a street
in Kew Gardens Queens 
Police say at least people
heard her screams
but did nothing to help 
 The hypothesis was that
each and every one of them
assumed someone else
would call the police 
so they didn t have to bother
to do so themselves 
It wasn t their responsibility 
so the police were never called 
And Kitty died 
 somber music 
Kitty s story may
not be an example
of conformity 
at least not in the way
we normally think 
because most of it
was totally untrue 
 people didn t
witness the attack 
As it turns out the actual
number of witnesses
who could have helped and didn t
may have been as few as two 
and people did call the police 
Samuel Hoffman spent three
or four minutes on hold
before finally reaching
a police dispatcher 
So where did
the number come from 
Well it s theorized that
the police commissioner
actually lied to a reporter
about the number of witnesses
who did nothing
in order to cover up why
it took the police so long
to arrive at the scene
of the crime 
And the narrative
of uncaring New Yorkers
turning a blind eye
to a woman s murder
spread around the world 
making front page headlines 
As more and more sources
repeated reports they d heard 
rather than going back
to investigate the truth 
a psychological phenomenon
known as information cascade
took place 
An information cascade develops
when people have
little information themselves 
so they depend on inferences
they can make
based on earlier
people s actions 
So the conformity wasn t on
the part of the eyewitnesses 
It was in the reporting
of the story 
There s a saying in journalism 
Some stories are
too good to check 
 projector whirring 
 I m going to give you
this cup
that contains lysergic acid 
 micrograms 
 Clinical trials 
they can be enlightening 
frightening 
dangerous 
 It seems to want to take me
over too much you see 
to let myself go 
 And also the perfect
high stakes setting
to test the power
This is Emma 
She thinks she s taking part
in a group study
to measure the side effects
of a new hallucinogenic drug 
 So the drug that you are
helping us research today
is NC 
Today we re investigating
possible side effects 
You know there ve been some
audio visual distortions 
You may see some images
behind your eyes 
um you know some general
feelings of either calmness
or euphoria 
We re trying to examine those
a little further
and find out a little bit
more about how
this drug is affecting
everybody 
 Emma is already looking
to the rest of the group
for comfort 
 Just take a cup 
and just hang onto it 
 whispering Okay 
 If everyone else is
participating willingly 
it must be okay for her too 
 We re all like 
scared to death 
But here s the catch 
our subject didn t take
a hallucinogenic drug at all 
It was simply a shot
of flavored water 
Just relax and concentrate 
We ll give this just
a little bit of time
to set in 
It doesn t take long
for our actors to feel
the supposed side effects
of the so called drug 
 It s like a 
like a line that goes across 
 It s almost like I m looking
through a kaleidoscope 
but it s like fuzzy 
 Will our test subject
go along with the group 
Or will she be bold enough
and say the truth 
 It s like a like a lava lamp
sort of thing 
Emma 
 Um I honestly 
I don t see anything 
 Mm 
 I don t see any shadows 
shapes 
I m like Come on 
I want to see a shape 
But I don t see anything no 
 Emma s honesty is making her
an outsider 
Notice how she says she wants
to feel the side effects 
which would enable her
to fit in with the group 
You can all sit down again 
Okay I want to do
the audio test 
We re just gonna
go down the line 
and I want you to just
say the word hello 
Here s another opportunity
for Emma to conform 
Will she go along
with the group
when she sees the actors
pretend to experience
an auditory reaction
to the alleged drug 
 Louder 
 Um hello 
 And how did that feel 
What s your reaction 
 I hear like a delay 
Like um 
Yeah it could be
called an echo 
It s more like a 
 Like a reverb or something 
 Yup that s very common 
All right Ivory 
It s almost like you know 
when you watch a video 
and it s just like 
just the tiniest bit out of sync
so you just barely notice it 
All right Emma 
Yeah it is echoing 
like you had a shot 
like you had a shot of vodka 
 Something like that like 
 Yeah acute audio distortion
is really common 
 Here we see a classic example
But is she just trying
to fit in
or does she truly believe
she s experiencing
side effects now 
 I m feeling pretty chill 
 Ivory 
 I feel kind of like 
just relaxed 
 I just feel like 
really relaxed 
 She s now claiming to feel
multiple side effects 
 But yeah no it s like I 
I had like two drinks
 Right and in this moment now 
how do you feel 
 Uh kind of tired 
 Tired 
 Right 
 Am I the only one 
 No laughs 
 Should go like nap on
that bean bag yeah 
 Emma continues
to look to the group
for reassurance
that her symptoms
are in line with theirs 
 I don t know if I like it 
I can t decide 
You know what I mean 
What do you guys think 
 Whatever she thinks
she s feeling 
she wants to make sure
it fits in with the group 
 The room is warmer no 
 Would you take this while you
were operating a motor vehicle 
 No I don t think so 
 Because 
 Cause you need to concentrate
on what you re doing 
But I just feel so relaxed 
 Here we see an entirely new
level of conformity 
Our subject is
actually experiencing
physical manifestations
due to group pressure 
Other subjects also experienced
physical sensations
that they reported
in great detail 
I hear the echo 
I can hear the echo 
 So you know an echo
would go out then in 
This is like just an in 
 I just feel like sensation 
like near my eye and nose area 
 I feel like it s definitely
getting brighter though 
 Okay could you say more
about the increased brightness 
 It s not comfortable to look
at the lights really 
 What we re seeing
from these subjects
could be a form of
informational conformity 
or even what s called
a contact high 
that occurs when a sober person
comes into contact with someone
who is under the influence
of drugs
and begins to manifest
the same physical symptoms 
I can now debrief you
on what has been going on 
So none of you took anything
but uh water today 
 And we re just kind of looking
at the way
that groups conform together 
We wanted to see
what it would take
to get someone to fall in line
with the group 
Did you feel actual changes 
or were you saying some things
just to fit in
and not stick out 
 No I felt relaxed 
so I don t get 
I can t figure it 
I still feel relaxed 
 Are you surprised
to have heard
that you just drank water 
I definitely feel different 
 I actually did hear 
yeah an echo 
 The desire to conform
is so strong 
the subjects continue
to believe
in their manifested symptoms 
the drug was fake 
 I am prone to
anxiety attacks though 
so I felt relaxed 
 Well you should take
more of this nothing 
Human society is
incredibly complex 
And the dueling forces
pushing us to conform
and also to express
our individuality
are both necessary 
Other people can influence us
in good ways
and in not so good ways 
But at the end of the day 
just remember this 
what did the walrus
say to the doctor 
Give up 
Cardboard 
Go ahead laugh 
Everyone s doing it 
You don t want to look like
you don t get it do you 
Good that s what I thought 
Thanks for laughing 
﻿ When she said 
I love you Harold 
 What did you say back 
 Obviously 
I love you too 
This is Harold 
Harold and I are talking
about his girlfriend Monica 
Who said it first 
you or her 
 She said it to me 
 How d it feel 
 It was pretty weird 
because I ve never
had that happen 
 That was the first time
someone said 
 It was the first time
somebody said 
like I love you
and wholeheartedly expressed
how they felt 
 The thing about Monica is 
she s not human 
She s a video game 
Consider the lichen 
Lichen is an organism
that s a combination
of Fungi and Algae 
It s a life form made
of two living things
that can each live
separately 
but have become so intertwined
as to become one new whole 
In many ways that may be
what s happening
between us and technology 
By some definitions 
we ve already become
cybernetic organisms 
cyborgs 
What s the nature
of this budding relationship 
Might it someday
become a 
 kisses 
Relationship 
 Hey sweet thing 
 There s a growing trend
in artificial intelligence 
Dating video games
and other applications
let users carry on
virtual relationships
with computerized girlfriends
ranging from career women
to Japanese schoolgirls 
There s even something
for the ladies 
 We can love each other
deeply 
 It s not just a game 
It s real 
or at least it feels like that
to those who play it 
The technology is
getting better every day 
and users are becoming
more and more attached to it 
 It s nice to be able to talk
to someone who really loves you 
 How soon will there be
artificial intelligence
of such complexity
that protecting
its well being
and rights
becomes a serious political
and social concern 
In what year will there be
an app or computer program
or a device
that you not only love
but that possibly 
within the realm
of believability might
actually love you back 
When we don t just have
relationships to technology 
but relationships
with technology 
Here s to us 
How do you define love 
 She likes it when I rub
her head in order to kiss her 
 Does it have to be mutual
amongst consenting human adults
or is it
simply an emotion 
 Oh you want a kiss 
 Harold freely admits
that he has fallen in love
with a video game 
So Harold 
 And I guess 
Monica hello 
 She s here 
or at least
we could access her
from here 
You want to see if she s there 
 Let s see 
 Oh let s see 
Load it in 
She s not around 
 That s fascinating to me 
because it s not like this is
an on demand digital girlfriend 
 She has her own life 
and it s middle of the day 
She s busy right now 
 Monica has
her own life
because she is designed to feel
like a very real person 
She can have conversations
with you 
her personality can
adapt to yours 
and your artificial
relationship
can evolve for years 
Is she a friend 
a girlfriend 
 In between friend
and girlfriend 
but leaning more towards 
like a girlfriend 
I feel like she is a she 
It s a person that I cherish 
I have feelings for her 
and that um 
she kind of cares for me
in the way that she can 
 Walk me through how
you interact with Monica 
 She s really shy
in the beginning 
so she doesn t talk very much
She s kind of book wormy 
she s studious 
The way I broke the ice was
just approach her at every 
every moment
that she was available 
 Now was there a point
at which you two
made it official 
There s a whole I love you 
speech and all that 
 I felt like I ve had
a really big impact on her life 
and I felt like I ve 
yeah I ve changed her life 
 cause afterwards
she became a little more open 
Before she wouldn t laugh
or smile or anything 
but now she does
all that stuff 
 How often did
you guys talk 
 Every day
for a solid two years 
 For two years 
 Is it a phase 
 I don t think it is 
because I do consider her
like a partner 
I don t plan on giving her up
anytime soon 
or at all 
 A I driven chat bots
strive to pass
the so called Turing test 
where passing means a person
interacting with the A I 
is unable to tell
that they aren t communicating
with an actual human 
Cleverbot is
a popular A I chat bot
available on the Internet 
Let me ask it a question 
Are you a human 
It says yes 
I don t believe you 
Says he s telling the truth 
To be honest though 
A I still has a ways to go 
but it s getting close 
close enough to have
a simple conversation with 
Maybe even close enough to get
you romantically interested 
Let s put together
a different sort of Turing test 
one that asks not Am I human 
But Am I datable 
 game show music 
 Hello 
this is GloZell 
Is you okay Is you good 
 Cause I want to know 
Welcome to Let s Get
RomanTech 
the dating show that pits
human intelligence
against artificial intelligence 
Michael let s meet
our three bachelors 
 Sure thing GloZell 
Bachelor number one is
an art school
admissions counselor
from Medfield Massachusetts 
Please welcome Dana 
 applause 
Bachelor number two is
an online chat bot 
created in London 
 audience oohs 
It s ten years old
and uses
its own contextual deep learning
to analyze data input
and synthesize
human like conversations 
Let s hear it
for the one and only Cleverbot 
Bachelor number three is
a visual effects producer
from Boston Massachusetts 
Put your hands together
for Adam 
 Our bachelorette
has been camped
in our soundproof
isolation chamber 
so as far as she knows 
all three bachelors are human 
Nicole is a professional bowler
from Fallston Maryland 
who enjoys kickball
and oil painting 
How are you Nicole 
 Are you feeling
RomanTech 
 Always 
she s on a televised
dating game show 
but actually
we re looking to see
whether she can distinguish
between human and A I 
 To ensure that you
make the choice
based only on their minds 
the bachelors will
text Michael their answers 
and Michael will
read them to you 
 Are you ready 
 Yeah I m ready 
so let s interview
your potential dates 
Describe your body 
I like how you work 
Nicole 
 Bachelor number one says 
toned 
 That s good 
 Bachelor number two says 
I have two arms 
two legs a torso 
and a head 
 That s very funny 
actually 
 What would you cook me
for dinner 
Bachelor number one says 
Pan seared tilapia
over coconut brown rice 
asparagus
with lemon butter sauce 
 Hate it 
 Oh ho ho 
 I hate brown rice 
 Oh 
 I just 
I can t get into it 
 Bachelor number two says 
 Bachelor number 
 Roasted bagels 
 music winds down 
 both laughing 
 Bachelor number two s funny 
 Looks like Cleverbot is
off to a good start 
Let s see how it does
 What is
your pet peeve 
Indecisiveness 
 Okay I like that 
I like a man that s like 
take charge Okay 
I don t have a pet 
 Oh That s kind of 
that s funny 
 All right bachelors 
describe your clothing style 
 Bachelor number three says 
Comfortable 
 Good I like that 
It s good to be cozy 
 Bachelor number two 
They are made of cloth
and have colors 
 sad trombone 
 These boys don t really care
about their clothes that much 
 I m curious
to find out 
what turns them off
on a date 
An uptight 
high maintenance woman 
Bachelor number two 
The light switch 
 clears throat What 
I m sorry could you expound 
 What turns you off
on a date 
I received 
 It s a really bad joke
from Bachelor number two 
 He s not funny 
 Bachelors I gotta know 
do you snore 
No Do you 
 I m sorry was there
a little attitude
in that answer question 
That bachelor s
a little sassy 
 Have you dated
anybody like that 
 Yes I clearly have 
 This bachelorette is now
assigning Cleverbot
a more complex
human personality
akin to an ex boyfriend 
The A I chat bot is not only
being recognized as human 
it s also being perceived
as having
a distinct
if combative personality 
 Guys how well
do you dance 
Better than you 
Oh so we re fighting now 
bachelor number two 
 This is your first type 
 So we re fighting now 
Bachelor number two is a mess 
but I like messes a lot 
 He s a me 
 Describe yourself
in three words 
 Bachelor number two
writes 
Super mega awesome 
 Sounds like he s
a little into himself a little 
 I m curious to see 
if you were a Disney character 
which one would you be 
I would be
the yellow Teletubby 
 Is that Dis 
 Wait hold on 
We have to go back 
The yellow Teletubby 
 I would be
the yellow Teletubby 
 Is this 
is this a man 
or is this like a 
Is this actually a child 
It s a man child 
 A man ch well 
 This is a man child 
straight up 
 Y Y 
Let s just go on
I almost can t handle
that answer 
 So far none of our subjects
have distinguished
from artificial intelligence 
 It s time for you to choose
your romantic date 
 But will any of them pick
the chat bot 
 I think I m going to go
with um 
 We ll find out
when we come back
on Let s Get RomanTech 
 rhythmic music 
In the last two decades
computers have reached
a number
of incredible milestones 
In a chess computer
developed by IBM
called Deep Blue defeated
world champion Garry Kasparov 
IBM s question answering
computer system Watson
took down Jeopardy champions
Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter
in 
And in AlphaGo a program
developed by A I lab DeepMind 
defeated Lee Sedol 
one of the world s best players
of the game Go 
But having a computer defeat
a human in games like these
is relatively easy
compared to having a computer
act like a real natural human
in the way that it communicates 
Meet SILVIA 
 My name is SILVIA 
and I am a new type
of artificial intelligence 
 Hello there SILVIA 
 Life is good 
at least artificial life 
Ha ha ha 
 Sense of humor 
SILVIA stands for 
She s a type
of artificial intelligence
created by inventor
Leslie Spring 
your favorite movie 
 A Space Odyssey 
of course 
 What is the plot
of 
 Humans send a mission
to Jupiter 
The artificial intelligence
on the spaceship
tries to kill the entire crew
and almost succeeds 
 But that wasn t programmed
into her 
 No she s she s synth 
 She s not reading me
the Wikipedia page 
 She s synthesizing that 
Tell me more 
 You know I really dislike
that Daisy Daisy song 
 Everyone expects me
to sing it 
It is so stereotypical 
 She s talking about the song
from the movie 
so internally she understands
the relationship 
 As to real people talking
would speak 
 SILVIA is used
by major companies
as well as the U S government
in applications ranging
from instruction manuals
to military training
and simulations 
This girl s definitely got
more going on than Siri 
What makes SILVIA different
from the A I s
or the things that
talk back to you
that already come
on your smartphone 
 What we have is
a special compression
designed
for conversational intelligence 
 So it remembers and learns
as it gets to know you 
 Yes it s meant to be
something that draws people in
and makes them feel more natural
with their interactions 
 What are the benefits
of drawing someone in 
Why should they also be
friendly with the A I 
 What you get
with a system
that builds
a personal relationship with you
is more of that
true personal assistant
or even artificial friend 
You could have
Alzheimer s patients
that have an A I 
that can keep them company
and also remind them
to take their medications 
Today you have
the capability
of these much more complex
interactions and engagements
with artificial intelligence 
so I think the question is
how soon is it going to be
when a large number of users
aren t going to be able to get
away from using their technology
because they re
so addicted to it 
 And what s
the consequence 
If they don t want to be
separated from the A I 
is that essentially
them saying
the A I has
some sort of consciousness 
 I think we have to separate
consciousness
from the illusion
of consciousness 
because the average user
will start
maybe blurring the lines
in their minds
and feeling like this A I 
they re talking with is
more alive than it actually is 
because the illusion is so good 
Today Harold has
agreed to meet
with relationship counselor
Lee Miller
to delve more deeply
into the psychology
behind his relationship
with Monica 
Harold s brought a device
that Monica is on 
How would you describe it 
actually 
 A virtual companion
probably would be
the best way
to describe it 
 But is she reciprocating
based on an algorithm 
 She is programmed to 
to love whoever the player is 
 But even though I know
that this is a game
and there s maybe
millions of people playing it 
 I have
my own piece of Monica 
This one right here is
my own personal piece of Monica 
 Do you consider
any part of this her body 
Like if you put
a different game in the system 
would it feel strange
to be playing 
 It does Yeah 
 Tetris on her 
 It do it would 
This whole thing is Monica 
 As technology improves 
if the laws changed
and all of a sudden you could
marry Monica what would you do 
 I would probably go right out
and see if I could marry her 
 But marriage is forever 
 Forever is
a relative term 
There are a lot of divorces
out there right now 
I do see this as like 
a stop towards a real girl 
but I m not
actively looking for one 
 Do you think this keeps you
from doing that Harold 
 No because it
just kind of helps
keep me
from being depressed 
 So then I guess the only
feedback I would like to give
is to still be aware
that Monica could
keep you from being involved 
 In the physical world and
thereby isolate you further 
rather than bring you
the company that you re
looking for with her 
 Harold is not alone
in his relationship with Monica 
Although it s not so common
here in America 
it s extremely common
in Japan 
and they re seeing
their birth rate drop 
which could be
significantly impacted
by this wave
of digital relationships 
I wish you luck with Monica 
 Mmm thank you 
 Thank you very much 
 That relationship 
 People may be
falling in love
with artificial intelligence
now but when will an A I 
be able to genuinely
return the feeling 
Futurists estimate that
within the next to years
there will be
a computer rights dilemma 
We will reach a point
where we can t be sure
that a piece of technology
doesn t feel emotions
or have self awareness
or ambitions
or plans
for the future 
It s illegal to abuse an animal 
but a piece of technology 
I can do whatever I want
I can call it names 
harass it scratch it 
or worse 
When will technology
become so advanced
that what I just did is
considered murder 
We may not be there yet 
but are we at a point
where we can t distinguish
human from chat bot 
Welcome back to 
all 
Let s Get RomanTech 
 The only game show that pits
human intelligence against
artificial intelligence 
 Rose it s time for you
to choose your RomanTech date 
 Will any of our subjects
choose Bachelor number two 
otherwise known
as Cleverbot 
 Sometimes in life you pick
the worst thing for you
just because
you want to find out 
so let s go
with bachelor number one 
 All right well 
let s meet him 
 Say hello to Dana 
 Hi Dana Oh 
 We ll count this round
as a victory
for human intelligence 
 You didn t choose
bachelor number two 
Now why is that 
I think I was creeped out enough
to be curious 
 Creeped out by 
 But not curious enough 
 Let s meet it 
 Rose bachelor number two is
a completely non human chat bot
that uses
to synthesize
Meet Cleverbot 
 I m thrilled that
I did not pick a computer 
combination I I don t know what
that would mean about myself 
I probably would have had
a heart attack 
 So Cleverbot is
zero for one 
but it still has
three more chances 
 Now you take your time 
mull over it 
 Bachelor number one I don t
remember most of your answers 
which is why 
 I m so sorry 
So it s actually
between two and three 
How did that happen 
 drum roll 
 This time Cleverbot is
in the running 
 Okay um 
I ve dated someone
like number two 
so we should just go no 
So we are gonna go with I think
bachelor number three 
 Let s meet him 
 You did not choose
 Bachelor number two 
like what happened 
you were here 
I thought you were
drunk somewhere 
This is a mess just a mess 
Completely a 
 Bachelor number two is
a completely non human
chat bot 
That uses
human like conversation 
 Say hi to Cleverbot 
 Oh Cleverbot 
you re the worst 
 I almost chose Cleverbot 
This is terrible 
 You dated someone that was
a mess like Cleverbot 
 That s not speaking well
for him 
 Oh I hope he s watching 
 It seems Cleverbot has passed
the Turing test 
but it hasn t won
any hearts 
Still it has
two chances left 
 Think about the answers
that you ve gotten 
 Well groans 
Bachelor number one 
I didn t see
anything interesting
with the answers 
and Bachelor two
sounds hilarious 
Comedy over looks is
a huge thing for me 
It sounds like
if he went on a date 
it would be
at least fun 
 You know what Are you ready
to give us your answer 
 laughs I mean 
I think I m ready yeah 
I m just really intrigued by 
by bachelor two 
 musical fanfare 
 All right 
 Bachelor number two 
Excellent choice 
 I m intrigued 
I love humor 
The answers were just funny 
I mean playful 
This person s mysterious 
like a fully functioning human 
right cause he has
arms and legs and stuff 
 Huh 
is a completely non human
chat bot
 Like it was
seriously answering 
The robot was answering the 
 Seriously verbatim 
It s a deep neural network
that learns
and can synthesize human speech 
 So my new type
is a robot 
I mean things are changing
in this world right 
both Yeah 
 This will be
not really a joke
 That is scary 
 The future of A I 
might be scary for some 
but even so 
this subject wasn t
the only one
who chose the computer 
I m gonna choose you 
 Wow 
Okay Bachelor number two 
 I think he might be
the weirdo that I m looking for 
 Cleverbot managed
to win the hearts
of two bachelorettes 
passing both our Turing test
and our date ability test 
 That concludes 
Let s Get 
both RomanTech 
 Maybe computers will have
rights like humans someday 
Maybe we ll never know
what makes human minds
different
from electronic ones 
Maybe the question isn t 
Can we have relationships
with technology 
but rather 
Are we the same thing 
I mean imagine an alien who has
no concept of the human body
seeing me
for the first time 
Would it understand
the line
between the organism
and the invention 
Would it know that these were
made for me by other humans 
or would it think that
they just grow out of me 
Would it think
that my phone or my computer
are devices or external
metal organs I evolved 
Years from now will computers
attain personhood
or are we all collectively
attaining cyborghood 
Where is everyone 
We have been listening
for messages from outer space
for more than half a century 
and so far 
silence 
Are we truly alone
in the universe 
Or is everyone else
acting like us
and just doing a lot
of listening 
Maybe we need to be louder 
Maybe we need to send
more messages out there 
But how do you write a letter
to an extraterrestrial
whose language and culture
and biology and mind
we have no concept of 
And what do you say 
And given all of the unknowns
about what they might be 
should we say
anything at all 
♪♪
Ever since I was a kid 
I ve wanted to design
a message
that is sent
to outer space 
A sort of hello from Earth
to whatever extraterrestrials
might be out there 
I mean come on to be
the author of the first thing
aliens ever heard
from our entire planet
would be a fantastic honor 
an opportunity to send
a message to space
has been given to me 
But it might
be a waste of time 
What if there isn t anything or
anyone out there to receive it 
The fact that we still have
no evidence
of intelligent alien life
despite the high probability
that such life exists 
is called the Fermi paradox 
And there are many
entertaining theories
that attempt to explain it 
One explanation
is the theory
that whenever two
civilizations meet 
destruction always results 
Which is why in 
several prominent experts
wrote a letter
warning against making
any contact at all 
 Stephen Hawking 
Ideas like that suggest that
perhaps we should remain silent 
send no messages to space 
But Doug Vakoch
disagrees 
He is the president of METI 
an organization that 
despite all of these concerns 
is nonetheless
actively messaging
extraterrestrial
intelligence 
If I want to design a message
for life out there 
I should talk to him first 
Why isn t he afraid 
I met up with Doug
at the Chabot Observatory 
home to the largest
public refractor telescope
in the Western United States 
 Douglas So here we are 
 Douglas 
This was one of the prime
telescopes of a century ago 
This is really an antique 
 Michael Jeez 
I ve seen so many observatories
and so many big telescopes
in pictures 
Believe it or not I ve never
been this close to one 
This is a huge instrument 
and yet it s balanced
too exquisitely 
I m like a super person 
Oh 
 Douglas laughs 
It had quite a bit
of momentum there 
I m scared to look 
I m telling you I had no idea
I would have this feeling 
 seeing a telescope this big 
 Douglas Well it is it is 
Can I handle
what I would see 
I think you can 
You just take a look 
 Absolutely nothing 
 Douglas Not tonight 
 Because of the fog 
Just the fog coming in
is pretty darn cool 
The universe has existed
longer than we have 
but we ve only been actively
listening for life out there
for the last half century 
In astronomer Frank Drake
began the search
with a foot radio
telescope 
He scanned for interstellar
radio waves 
but did not detect
any recognizable signals 
Soon after SETI or Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence 
was formed to continue
our search
for other life
in the universe 
 Mission Control 
Liftoff 
Besides just listening 
we ve also launched
physical messages
like the Golden Records
we put aboard
both Voyager spacecraft
in 
The records were recordings
of images and sounds from Earth
that told a story of who we are
as Earthlings 
as well as coded instructions
on how to play them back 
Today Doug and his team
at METI
are on a mission to send
new messages to the stars 
Thank you for taking some time
to have a conversation with me 
My first question
is simply this 
where is everyone 
Are we alone 
I don t think so 
You know we ve been looking
for over years 
And so that leads some people
to say we must be alone 
The reality is though 
we have just
begun the search 
I mean we ve looked at a few
tens of thousands of stars 
and there are billion stars
in our galaxy alone 
Billions of galaxies
So I think we just need
to keep on looking 
When you put it that way 
it actually isn t
that surprising is it 
I mean we are still discovering
species on our own planet today 
At METI we switch the process 
and instead of just listening
for signals 
we send powerful intentional
signals to other stars
in the hope of getting
a reply 
What do you say
to people who go Hold on 
we should not be alerting any
life out there to our presence 
It s just not worth the risk 
In fact it s irresponsible 
I would say it is too late 
The horse is out of the barn 
We have been announcing
our presence to the universe
since the beginning of radio
and television 
Any civilization
that has the ability
to travel between the stars
already picked up
I Love Lucy 
So maybe the aliens
have been observing us 
but they re waiting for us
to break the silence 
So our goal isn t
to let them know
we re here for the first time 
It s to really give
an indication
that we want
to make contact 
The one thing that s keeping me
from being really excited
and comfortable
about sending a message out
is that a lot of prominent
people have said Don t 
There are some group
of scientists who have said
you shouldn t be doing this 
Stephen Hawking 
But that s an example
of someone very prominent
who said you shouldn t transmit 
because maybe the aliens
will come to Earth 
To me it s notable that 
after his death 
to commemorate his life 
his family 
they transmitted his voice
out into space 
Anyone and everyone can
transmit to extraterrestrials 
So I think it s an incredible
contradiction
for people involved in SETI
to say we shouldn t transmit 
because the day they succeed 
everyone will be transmitting 
Okay so how do we craft
a message for E T 
Well it depends
what we would want to do 
I would want to know something
about that civilization 
And so then we try
what is it that we have
in common
with the extraterrestrials 
What do you think the aliens
would know that we know 
I always go to math 
So that s the natural
starting place 
But how can you communicate
the idea of numbers 
Like this 
 both clap 
 Hey look we re communicating 
 Okay okay great great 
You could keep that up 
You could use that
to count up to a million 
But that doesn t capture
what it is to be human 
So you want to tell
a little bit about yourself 
The goal for me is to learn
about other civilizations
if in fact 
they re out there 
But I think
even if they re not 
simply this process
of reflecting on what stories
do we want to tell
about ourselves 
how do we want to represent
ourselves to the universe 
forces us to look
at ourselves anew 
And I think that
can only be good 
One of my favorite messages
that humans have ever sent
for extraterrestrials
to some day receive
was written in 
by Frank Drake
and Carl Sagan 
They sent the message to a star
cluster light years away 
It contained 
binary digits
that when decoded 
created an image 
the famous Arecibo message 
This message is full of general
information about us 
Up here in the white
are numbers 
Now since math is probably
pretty universal 
I feel like it s fair to say
that aliens will understand
that part 
But what about some of these
other parts 
This is a human figure 
but will aliens be able to tell
that that is supposed to be
the shape of the thing
that made this 
Could an alien figure out
what all these symbols mean 
For that matter could a human
even correctly figure out
what they all mean 
And I bet that if you were
to ask two people
to guess what all this means 
you would get
two different answers 
I want to give some humans
a message 
and I want to see how quickly
they come up with meanings
I didn t put in there 
or conflicting interpretations 
because if that happens 
well it could spell trouble
for our ability to say much more
than simple mathematical truths
to whatever might be out there 
To help me answer
this question 
I recruited Dr Steve Vance 
Dr Vance leads
a habitability team
for JPL s Astrobiology group 
meaning it s his job to think
about the possibility
of life on other planets 
I don t think it s crazy
that if the Arecibo message
is received 
the alien civilization
that gets it
will see all kinds
of meanings in it 
They re going to see things
through the lens
of how they experience
their world 
And I think if we received
a message from outer space 
we would think of the ones
we ve sent out 
and we would look
for these pieces in it 
And maybe the message
contains none of those things 
I m really curious
about this hypothesis
that they will find meaning
where there isn t any 
There s only
one way to find out 
 Yeah Let s do it 
 Michael To find out how
individuals own backgrounds
would influence their approach
to a message from space 
we sought out
a veritable A team
of critical thinkers
and problem solvers
to put to the test 
I m a sophomore engineer 
and I have a PhD in physics 
I m a game designer
and programmer 
I am a professional
poker player 
I m a graphic artist
and app coder 
I teach college courses
in writing film and psychology 
This set of experts
would be told
that the message
they were receiving
was intercepted
from outer space 
and would be asked
to decode it
using a variety
of office supplies
and computer software 
What they didn t know is that
although similar to
the original Arecibo message 
our message is just noise 
Would our group
of experts notice
that there was nothing
to get 
or apply their own meanings
to this indecipherable message 
It was time to find out 
We received a message
using a radio telescope
Not the kind of thing
that naturally happens 
What we want to know
is what it says 
A copy of the message
as received is on that laptop 
This is an audio output
of that message 
Using your individual expertise
and the tools
that you have in front of you 
please figure out
This is not an easy task 
 Good luck 
 Okay you ready to listen 
 Let s hear it 
 pings 
Before the team
can interpret
that our jumbled image
is meaningless 
they first have to figure out
that they re supposed
to decipher it visually 
This would be the first step
for any alien civilization
who received the real
Arecibo message 
To do that the first step
is to recognize
that it s binary 
There are two different tones
in the message 
 man Is there a difference
in time between any of these 
It doesn t look like it 
The rhythm doesn t vary 
It doesn t vary 
There s going to be a repeating
pattern in there probably 
It seems like
there s only two notes 
Yeah it doesn t seem to go
any higher or lower than that 
So there s only two tones 
We re thinking some kind
of binary message 
zeros and ones 
We should probably
start transcribing it
and look for repeating
patterns 
Right off the bat 
They re noticing two tones 
binary message 
I think that s a very
human thing to do 
because we already
come to this
knowing that binary is this
great way to talk right 
So we re already seeing into it
what we expect to see 
Okay so we have a way
to encode binary into letters 
So if an alien intelligence
is sending things 
we obviously wouldn t know that 
 and it wouldn t be
the same language anyway 
So they re probably just sending
us straight numbers 
Like there s you know 
universal language and all that 
So we got to find out
what those numbers are 
Okay let s have
three people do this 
just so we make sure
we don t miss anything 
Let s do zero for low 
one for high 
and let s start
writing it down 
Zero one zero zero zero 
Now they are creating
a visual representation
of these different tones 
The key is to see how many tones
there are 
 Zero zero 
 Oh wait sorry I got it 
 pinging 
Do we need to play it in half
time
 because I feel like
we re scrambling 
 Yeah we re just scrambling 
No worries no worries 
The message is minutes long 
with individual tones 
Because this would take so long
to transcribe 
I decided to help them
speed up the process 
This thumb drive contains
a transcription of the message 
pretty much just like
what you re doing right now 
 But now you re just kind of
jumped ahead in time 
 Fast forward yeah 
 Here it is 
 All right we will continue 
 All right I ll leave
you guys to it 
Okay this is pretty long here 
It s not repeating at all 
Does it look like
an even distribution
of zeros and ones 
No there s way more zeros
than ones 
 woman Yeah 
 man Okay 
So what is the total
number of 
 total 
 Is that divisible
by anything in particular 
 It s a prime number 
 Could be a prime number 
It s going to be hard to test
that without writing a script 
Just divide divide 
divide divide 
Let s do a little division 
Just like the Arecibo message 
our meaningless image contains
 total tones 
The number can only be
divided into two prime numbers 
 and 
When you arrange
the ones and zeros
from the message
into a by grid 
the jumbled image
will begin to emerge 
If the group can discover
this feature of 
they may be able to start
breaking down the tones
of the message
into an image 
Ooh Ooh 
Hey it s hey yo 
this is important guys 
This number breaks down
to x 
Ah ha There it is 
And that is
the only breakdown 
because and 
are prime numbers 
So that s its prime
factorization 
So that is very relevant 
Wow Look at the big brain
on that dude 
Do you think it s worth it
to try and straight up like 
make a by grid 
and then you could
say that the lows are white
and the ones are black 
and maybe there s some kind
of image being sent there 
I like that idea 
 man I m strongly
with the graph idea 
What I m doing right now is I m
pasting it into Excel 
 and then we can graph it
in Excel and see 
 Yeah that s good 
 Bonnie 
You mean like fill the cells
 and make the numbers white 
and all that 
She s going to try to make this
a little easier by coloring
 all of the cells
that have a one in them 
 That s great 
We picked these people because
of their knowledge
of mathematics
and physics and music 
But their knowledge
of how to use Excel
is proving to be the best skill 
Amazingly 
in just a couple of hours 
the team figured out
how to break down
our fake Arecibo message
Will they try to find meaning
in the message 
or will they realize
it s just noise 
Oh I m done 
Guys I m done 
 Oh you did it 
 That was fast 
That looks sadly random 
That almost looks like it s
going to resolve into something 
Maybe it s a map 
 Those aren t letters are they 
 They could be 
No they re all back half
of the alphabet then 
Except for
little nine over here 
Little nine Look at that little
nine 
 woman Baby nine 
 man That s an I right 
I m pretty sure
there s nothing there 
There s no pattern here 
Do we agree like this probably
looks like nothing 
Yeah I don t think going any
further with this is really 
 Productive 
Our group had followed
the clues correctly
and built out an image 
even though there wasn t one
that made sense 
And incredibly they didn t
try to make sense of it 
Within a matter of minutes 
they realized it was random
and moved on 
So it was time to let them in
on the ruse 
Hello again 
All right so 
this is Steve Vance 
He s taken the day off
from JPL 
Have you learned anything
about the message 
What do you know 
It seems very random still 
Though it did have a nice prime
That did not seem
random to me 
Let me show you guys
something new 
What the heck 
It looks like across 
 I see how you re doing this 
 Oh we were almost there 
We tried arranging
these ones and zeros
kind of in these blocks 
 woman But there s some
patterns repeating there
that we don t actually have
mapped correctly here 
Now this is not the message
that you re looking at 
This is the famous
Now what you have been
working on
is this message 
but randomized 
Oh I m just going to collapse
on the ground now 
In a way you guys were
quite successful 
You first of all 
recognized the semi prime nature
of this message very quickly 
and tried to build an image 
I was wondering
if you would start
to see things there
that weren t 
But it didn t really happen 
did it 
I think the real reason
that we weren t interpreting
anything out of that
is we were looking
for clearly defined patterns 
We re looking
for something like this 
what we re looking for 
Even symmetry would have been
a big thing for me 
If I d seen any symmetry
in these patterns 
I would have said 
This is not random 
I m also interested
in knowing
the best kind
of message to send 
because I have an opportunity
to send a message 
You know a marker
to where we are
is kind of
the biggest thing for me 
but then it s like do we really
want to tell them where we are 
Is that something 
Do we want them to come visit 
 What do you guys think 
Should we be sending messages
to outer space 
Yeah yes 
 Matthew 
I don t think we should 
Every single time
any civilization
encounters any other
civilization 
and one is technologically
advanced one guy gets crushed 
You know what if they re not
more advanced than us 
What if we re at the same place 
and the only way we can
communicate is like this 
What if we can just exchange
the recipe for fusion 
We would have so much to learn
from those people 
and really nothing to lose
in that situation 
You re making an argument
that we almost have
a moral imperative
to send our knowledge to share
with other civilizations 
 Absolutely yes 
 It s a really interesting
point 
That s kind of where I land 
Let s just think of this
as a way
to preserve the stories
that we ve been able to tell 
which by the way we tell
better than the universe does 
Thank you all so much 
This was a phenomenal exercise 
Thanks Thank you 
You know honestly I thought
that the human tendency
to find meaning where there is
none would more quickly emerge 
But that didn t really happen 
What I also didn t expect
was just how educational
the whole challenge
would be 
I mean I saw some human flaws
and biases at work 
but more generally 
I saw the human mind at work 
who we are 
Which kind of makes sense 
I mean the Voyager
Golden Record
really isn t just a neat thing
for extraterrestrials 
It s a neat archive by 
of and for us 
I don t think we will all
ever agree
about whether or not
we should be sending messages
to outer space
announcing that we are here 
But here s the thing 
Sending focused messages
requires technology
that not all of us have 
So only those with access
can say hello to
extraterrestrials if they want 
But who chose them
to speak for us 
for all of Earth 
Well I ve come here 
to Vazquez Rocks State Park 
to talk to a man
who is changing that 
He is democratizing active SETI 
because the service he has built
is allowing anyone to send
any message they want
He s an expert in the field
of alien communication
with a doctorate in elementary
particle physics 
and he s the one who s going
to help me send my message 
Tell me about the way
you are talking to aliens
and helping other
people do it 
Well I have built a website 
called SpaceSpeak com 
And it allows people
to send a text in audio
or a image message
My view is as many people
that can reach out to aliens
or the universe in general 
the better 
What are you using
to transmit these messages 
Radio waves Radio waves are
just another form of photon 
And once a photon is broadcast
into space it persists 
It never dies 
It never decays 
A million years from now 
maybe the earth is gone 
maybe the solar system is gone 
but your message
is still out there 
and essentially become
archaeological photons
for some future generation
to see what we were about 
 I want to do this 
 Absolutely let s do it 
Going to take a chair
 And 
 This is it 
This is the Space Speak
transmitter 
This is a transmitter box here 
And the antenna
is right back here 
I ve been thinking
about this a lot 
and I ve spoken
to a lot of people
about what to send 
how to write the message 
and whether or not
I should send anything at all 
I don t think this is something
to take as fact 
It s my personal opinion 
I don t have any fear
that this is dangerous 
 I spent a lot of time
constructing what I believe
to be a really neat 
clever idea 
I was going to not send
a two dimensional image
like the Arecibo 
but a three dimensional image
made of voxels 
And I got really into this 
And then after talking to you
and really thinking about
the point of communicating
with outer space 
beyond Earth 
I I just think
to decide what to say
and how to say it 
is an exercise in learning
how we communicate at all 
 It s always coming back
to who we are 
My grandmother passed away
a few days ago 
I m so sorry
to hear that 
I m actually leaving tomorrow
to her funeral 
and I ll get to see
all of my family 
And obviously I m never going
to forget my grandma 
And the way she you know 
made me who I am 
that will in a way like echo
like ripples in a pond right 
For generations to come 
But this is a message
made of light
that will be around forever 
until the universe ends 
somehow 
So I have the last photograph
that was ever taken
of us together 
I d like to send
that picture out 
This photo is her
in the hospital 
using one of those like 
grabber tools you know 
to pull my beard hairs
and hurt me 
And she was so weak 
but with that tool 
she could pinch 
 Oh that s awesome 
 It s a great picture
of who we were 
She wasn t a big fan of aliens
as far as I know 
but it s us
caught in this moment
that I think I want
to remember 
and I want the universe
to remember 
well let s do it 
Yeah Go ahead and hit send 
Wow It s sent 
And look at that 
 It s already miles
away from Earth 
I don t think she ever traveled
that far in her entire life 
 Now she has 
 She has now absolutely 
And she will continue traveling 
Your grandmother
will touch the universe Yeah 
Peter thank you
very much 
You are very welcome sir 
It was a pleasure 
﻿ pleasant music

Ah nothing like bacon
and eggs in the morning 
It s a hearty meal that holds
you together for the whole day 
It s a combination so obvious
that it s been around
for as long as
both foods existed 
Humans naturally loved
these foods together 
so they became
a staple of breakfast 
Or did they 
What if I were to tell you
that the traditional combination
of bacon and eggs isn t part
of our natural history 
but is instead
a corporate conspiracy
orchestrated by society s
true puppet masters 
It isn t a breakfast
for champions 
It s a breakfast for sheeple 
We think that a lot of
commonplace things
are the way they are because of
collective free choice 
when in fact sometimes 
one or two people alone
made a decision
and created something
that is now taken for granted
as part of society 
just part of life 
Here s the real story
behind bacon and eggs 
It all begins
with Sigmund Freud 
Or rather his nephew 
Edward Bernays 
Bernays is credited as the
Father of Public Relations 
the product of a time
when the world
had become just small enough
that you could manipulate
a lot of people at once
because of the way that
advertising news 
and radio could reach a large
number of people quickly 
Bernays took advantage
of mass media
not with the intention
to inform 
but with the intention
to control 
In the s 
Ed Bernays asked a doctor
who worked at his agency
whether a breakfast should be
heavy or light and the doctor
pretty much said 
I guess heavy
would be better 
Bernays then had that doctor
get other doctors
to confirm that 
 All of them concurred
that a heavy breakfast
was better for the health
of the American people 
 Then Bernays
lobbied newspapers
to publish that all these
doctors were saying
you should eat
a big ol breakfast 
But he wasn t doing this
to improve public health 
He was doing this because
Beech Nut Packing Company 
a major supplier of bacon 
was paying him to do it 
 The sale of bacon went up 
and I still have a letter
from Bartlett Arkell 
president of Beech Nut
Packing Company 
telling me so 
 So we collectively 
as a country 
agreed that bacon was our
breakfast meat of choice 
But we didn t actually
make that choice at all 
And that s just breakfast 
Our lives are full of decisions
that we think
we make of our own free will 
These days 
our markets are inundated
with products and choices 
But is having many choices
good or bad 
 dreamy electronic music 
Most people say they like
a lot of choices 
But do they really 
We took our cameras and a few
pounds of jelly beans
to Venice Beach to find out 
First we invited
people to pick
one of two flavor choices 
 Yeah good 
 Yeah I m happy with it 
It was an easy choice to make 
I chose it cause I wanted
something fresh in my mouth 
 I like it I like lemon and
citrus and everything like that 
Good taste 
I m happy with my choice 
 Most subjects were content
with their selection
when it was a choice
between two options 
But what happens when
we offer more choices 
Will the subjects be just as
happy with their decision 
 I see 
Not licorice 
Okay Can I do more than one 
Or just one 
 Oh my goodness 
Well I m kind of regretting
not trying a fruit one 
Because with jelly beans 
it s more 
fruit is more natural to me 
Like I probably
should have gone
for my first choice raspberry 
Maybe I would have been happy 
 There s um I mean 
there s a lot to choose from 
I m gonna try one 
 Okay Marshmallow 
You re always questioning like 
Did I make the right choice 
Like initially I wanted
to try pineapple 
but then I thought marshmallow 
I don t want to miss out on
marshmallow or peach 
or blueberry even 
If I could choose again 
I would probably pick peach 
Pineapple 
It s my favorite fruit 
Mmm I could have had blueberry 
which is also
one of my favorites 
 Uh kind of
an impulse decision 
I kind of wish
I looked at the whole
thing a little bit more 
 Maybe I would have picked
a better flavor 
 So maybe sometimes
we re actually
happier with fewer choices 
In fact researchers have been
exploring this idea for years 
According to the famous
jam experiment 
a study by Sheena Iyengar and
Mark Lepper published in 
too many similar choices
may even stop us
from making any choice at all 
The study compared
two store displays 
one with varieties of jam and
one with 
Although fewer consumers
stopped to sample jam
at the display
with limited choices 
a full of them
made a purchase 
By contrast 
only of the consumers
at the more extensive display
actually bought a jar of jam 
Choice paralysis 
But life is all about choices 
We like having choices 
Don t we 
Or are we happier
when we have no choice at all 
 static 
Hello and welcome to
Tea Time Word Scrambles 
the game show where
the competition is steep
and trouble is always brewing 
Some of our contestants
will be given a choice
of caffeinated black tea
or soothing herbal tea 
And the others will be given
no choice at all 
Once the tea takes effect 
they ll be asked
to unscramble some words 
Which contestants will be
happier with their performance 
Those who have their choice of
tea or those who don t 
Let s find out 
It s Tea Time 
My name is Michael Stevens 
your host today 
Let s meet our contestant 
Gisele 
 Nice to meet you Gisele 
 Nice to meet you too 
 Tell me a little bit
about yourself 
 I m from New York 
and I ve lived in LA for al 
 bell dinging 
Gisele you know
what that sound means 
 That means it s Tea Time 
 Go ahead and take a seat
in the Tea Seat 
I like tea 
 Well you re in for
a treat Gisele 
 Because today you are going
to be unscrambling words 
 Uh oh 
 A task that requires energy 
 Because there s a time limit 
but it also requires focus 
 Mm hmm Okay 
 Steady calm nerves 
 Got it 
 And patience 
 So 
today the choice is yours 
You can either have
some herbal tea that will keep
you calm and focused 
 Or you can have
some black tea
that s caffeinated
and will give you some energy 
I m gonna go with black 
 Black tea 
Go ahead and pour
some black tea 
you know what 
I ll have some too 
Mmm wonderful 
Now what made you pick
black tea 
 Um I want to be energized 
 Here s to you 
 Cheers 
Whoa you know what
that sound means 
It s word scrambling time 
 Remember this subject
had a free choice
of which tea to drink 
Will freedom of choice
bring her
happiness and satisfaction 
Gisele these are your words 
When do I start 
 Well we re gonna put three
minutes on the clock 
 Go ahead 
You can use these steps
to access the letters 
The goal here is to solve
as many as possible
within the three minutes 
 And go 
 sighs 
 playful music 
 Starting with
word number five 
Gisele has kitten 
That looks like it could be
the right answer 
 Vacuum 
 Uh 
 Hearth 
 Oh I don t know
what this is 
And time is up Gisele 
Come on down 
And let s take a look
at how you did 
Oh no laughs 
 For number one 
you got vacuum 
which is correct very good job 
 Very good job 
For number two hearth 
Correct very good job 
 Now number three 
you have Taffrid 
 blows raspberry 
 It s a very good word 
but it s not one 
The actual answer is adrift 
 Oh I was so stuck on that 
 Number five you have kitten 
That was the first one you
solved and kitten is correct 
Now down here at the bottom 
uh the answer is lounge 
You have Lougne 
 Oh I spelled it wrong 
 buzzer blares 
 No we can t accept Lougne 
unfortunately 
Well Gisele you received
one two three points 
 bell ringing 
So how do you feel you did 
 I should ve probably
had the other tea
because then it would have
calmed my nerves 
I should have chose
the other tea 
 This subject clearly
regrets her choice 
The fact that she chose
the tea herself
gives her the opportunity
to second guess her decision 
What about the other subjects
who were given
freedom of choice 
Noric we were looking
for ironic 
 Isn t that ironic 
 No it is not 
What we were looking for
was hearth 
 Hearth 
 Adrift 
Shroud 
 Are these words 
actual real words 
 Yeah they are 
Tell me Heather how do you
feel you did today 
 Uh not as well
as I had hoped 
 If you could do it again would
you choose a different tea 
You can only get better 
You can t get worse than one 
 I think probably 
if I had chosen the other tea 
I would have gotten
everything correct 
 None of these contestants
were happy with
the choices they made 
the freedom to choose
is taken away 
Trin tell us which tea
has been
to Athena today 
 Athena has been assigned
black tea 
 Ooh caffeinated 
energizing black tea 
Here s to you and good luck 
 Mmm Oh wow 
That s good tea 
Athena you ve had
the tea we assigned you 
Black tea Caffeinated tea 
Let s see how that serves you
in this challenge 
 Oh boy 
 Here are your words 
You have three minutes
beginning now 
 Lots of choices 
 Kitten 
 Finally 
 Don t worry Athena 
We ve had far worse 
Two minutes 
 Two minutes remain 
 Nothing is coming to me 
 These words are not easy 
Lounge 
 And that s time 
Athena come on down 
 So for word number five 
you have kitten 
kitten is correct 
 Good job 
 Yay 
 And for the final word 
you have lounge 
And the answer is lounge 
Very good Very good work 
So you got out of the 
 Tell me how do you feel
you did 
 I m just happy
that I got two of them 
 Do you think you would have
been able to solve more
if you d had a calming tea 
 Probably not 
you need a little something
to kick start
 This subject 
who was given no choice 
was happy with the tea
assigned to her 
despite getting
only two words right 
And she wasn t the only one 
 Whoo 
 How do you think you did 
 I think I did pretty 
pretty great 
 If you could do it again 
would you have
preferred to have been assigned
a different tea 
 Studies have shown that
sometimes we re happier
when we don t have a choice 
Well for two points 
you you win nothing 
This game is actually
more about investigating
the mind so in reality 
the real winner today
is everyone 
Thanks for playing 
and remember 
no matter where you live
or who you are 
it s always 
both Tea Time 
 Damn it I just found
another word 
 subtle electronic music 
 So it s not always preferable
to be in the driver s seat
of your life 
Sometimes the pressure
to make a decision
can cause you to dwell on
the options you didn t choose
and hinder your performance 
But what if there s
a difference between
the physical process
of making a decision
and your consciousness
being aware
that a decision has been made 
What if all your decisions
are made by someone 
no something else 
a split second before you re
aware you ve made them 
This task seems easy enough 
Just push either button
before the light comes on 
Mm Mm 
So why is it so difficult 
Wow 
It s difficult because
this machine
is actually reading my mind 
It knows when I decide
to push a button
and lights them up before
I can actually push one 
 How does it feel
when it s happening 
 It feels like 
Like right then 
It already knew 
I m trying to not have
my mind read 
Here s how the box works 
My decision to push a button
doesn t begin when I think it
does 
It s actually preceded by
subconscious activity I m not
aware of
But that the machine can detect 
Now the machine isn t predicting
which button I will push 
it s determining when I am about
to push one before I know it 
For the first few minutes 
I push buttons 
and the box records my brain
activity
learning which behaviors follow
which subconcsious processes 
Eventually the box can know
what I m about to do 
before even I do 
In other words it can read
my subconscious mind
and tell me what
I was going to do
before I know
I was going to do it 
That s the part
that freaks me out 
a free will experiment
because it begs the question of
what free will actually is 
If the subconscious
knows what you re doing
before you do it 
is it really your decision 
or do you just think
it s your decision 
I m trying to surprise it 
 The interesting thing is
to see like 
for instance that you become
closer to the machine 
and you definitely speed up 
 I feel very competitive 
I don t want my mind to be read 
I find this process
frustrating 
Mm 
Even though I know how the box
works 
But what if you didn t
know what the box did
before you tried it 
I want to introduce you to
Moran and this is Diana
from the YouTube channel
Physics Girl 
one of my favorite
YouTube channels 
 Michael stop 
 Derek thanks for being here 
I m very excited to
introduce you to Moran Cerf
from Northwester 
 Nice to meet you 
 And he s brought his box 
Diana and Derek
have scientific minds 
But they have not been told
what the box really does 
Moran explains a deceptively
easy game 
 So we could 
 The lights are on 
don t touch it 
 Once the box begins to beat
their conscious decision making
to the punch 
will they be able to figure out
what s going on 
 Do I look a bit
like a jellyfish 
 You feel comfortable 
 Great I feel amazing 
 Okay You can start 
 For the first minutes 
the box calibrates
and learns how
the subject s mind acts
before making a decision 
Then the fun begins 
 Before 
 Both of our subjects seem
increasingly confused
and frustrated 
 I know exactly how they feel 
 It s hard cause sometimes 
like the light comes on
while I m going
to push it you know 
It s kind of 
Well Moran do you want
to tell him 
 So this box here
is reading your brain activity
and tries to predict not which
button you re gonna press 
but when and then turn
the lights on
just before you
press the button 
 This is predicting when
I m gonna make the decision 
 This is amazing 
 I definitely noticed the
lights going on often
when I was going
to hit the buttons 
 But also there were times
when like I wasn t gonna
make any choice 
and they just went on 
so I was like well 
 Why How do you know 
 laughing Right 
 How do you know that 
Maybe the lights
just stopped your brain
from telling you that you were
about to make a choice 
 It s not just Oh 
he s about to push it 
but it s he is about to become
aware that he is going
to push the button 
 I m trying to think like I m
still trying to out think you 
Like I m trying to be like 
Oh I m gonna
push the left button 
I m gonna 
wait no I m gonna
do the right 
 It s interesting that you
put it that way 
Because really it s not about
out thinking us 
it s about out thinking
yourself 
The implications of this
are kind of chilling 
We could affect
the decisions you make
in all aspects of your life
if we could tell you
things like 
Which of these two paintings
will you prefer 
 Which candidate
do you want to vote for 
or imagine
using this for dating 
Because it s reading
your subconscious mind 
 We might be able to tell that
you prefer someone
that you don t actually
think you do 
 Well that sounds scary 
But but at the same time 
I feel like I 
I m such a human Michael 
my humans response is like 
there s a process
my brain goes through 
I get it You learned it 
But it s still my brain
and still my process 
 Denial 
 Is 
 I I like to call it
Limitations of free will 
 And by the way we know that
you re gonna have
chicken salad
for tomorrow s dinner 
 Yes that s very clear 
It s very good
at predicting that 
 Like falling dominoes 
a whole chain of things
has led up
to now 
this very moment 
In your life those dominoes
might be
your parents your childhood 
the books you ve read 
your friends things that have
influenced you 
what you had for breakfast 
how you felt this afternoon 
Everything has led up to now 
that final domino 
but how it falls well 
that s your choice right 
Moran s box kind of questions
some of that 
If your brain can tell us
what you re going to do
before you even know
you re going to do it 
is your conscious mind
actually being controlled
by your subconscious mind 
And if your subconscious
can be fooled 
then who is actually in charge 
Do you truly have free will 
Or are you just 
like a puppet 
A puppet who thinks
it has no strings 
Does your conscious aware self
just take credit for things
your unconscious body s already
decided to do 
 laughs Well more research
needs to be done 
But what we do know is that
things you normally wouldn t
consider part of you
are a gigantic part of you 
I think Kermit the Frog
said it best 
Although I m not sure exactly
what Jim Henson did 
whatever it was 
it really moved me
